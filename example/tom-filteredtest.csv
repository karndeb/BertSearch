Xbox Series X Pics & SSD Specs Appear: Here's What We Know,"Specifications for Microsoft’s next console, Xbox Series X (also known by codename Project Scarlett) are slowly coming out. We already know that it will ,an,, along with a ""next-gen"" AMD , that will pack hardware-based ,. We've also known for a while that the new Xbox will pack a great new ,, but up until today the details have remained somewhat scarce.,More information has also surfaced about the console's rear I/O.,At CES, AMD showed a render of the Xbox Series X during its keynote, which showed the console's rear I/O connectivity. This got many of us excited, however, ,. It was made using a 3D model from TurboSquid, and we also suspected that the connectivity shown wasn't representative of the end product. ,Fast forward two weeks to today, and it looks like Twitter user , posted two pictures of an Xbox Series X prototype on the NeoGAF forums, corroborated by ,.,Although this is still a prototype (as  indicated on the unit), these images are interesting for two main reasons: we get to see the connectivity, and they're images of the actual hardware, not renders.,As far as the connectivity goes, there's an HDMI port, SPDIF optical audio port, power, Ethernet, and two USB SuperSpeed ports. The front of the unit has an additional USB port.,
What's notable is the single HDMI port. On the Xbox One, Microsoft had both HDMI-in and HDMI-out. The HDMI-in would let you route devices like a cable box through the console, which would be the one device connected to a television. It appears Microsoft is considering abandoning that approach.,We can only speculate that the new Xbox will feature HDMI 2.1, because if it doesn't, it won't be able to meet Microsoft's promise of ,fps. Naturally, HDMI 2.1 would also add support for VRR (Variable Refresh Rate).,A few days back a report from Digitimes claimed that the ,, though it wasn't clear exactly which controller Microsoft would end up selecting for the new console. At the time, the Phison E16 was the obvious choice, but we also knew that Phison has the E18 controller in the pipeline, which could offer an alternative option.,
,
Nevertheless, a new rumor from the LinkedIn profile of an unknown software engineer. appears to point towards the use of a DRAM-Less Phison E19 controller that is engineered for use in consoles, cameras, tablets and more. ,The profile as was spotted by , and ,.,Despite the E19 controller's higher name designation than the E16 controller, it looks like the E19 won't reach the 7 GB/s throughput that the E16 is capable of. Instead, it has a maximum read speed of 3.7 GB/s and peak write speeds of 3.0 GB/s. Of course, these figures are no surprise as the previously reported 7 GB/s would be quite excessive for a gaming console.,Although Phison's infographic shows that the controller can deal with up to 2TB worth of NAND memory, ,, though there would also be a lighter 512GB option. Given that today's games can easily exceed 50GB in their installation size, these capacities wouldn't be surprising. These large SSDs in the new consoles are even expected to gobble up as much as 5 percent of the SSD shipments in 2020.,There is a ,, hence the name Xbox ,It is possible that these rumored high-end specifications are for a top-end version of Xbox Series X (if there will be more than one), and that the lower-spec model is aimed at only playing games at 1080p, while also streaming games and media. "
Samsung Reportedly Invests $8B More in China Plant,"Samsung is betting on China. Reuters, citing Chinese state media, today said the company , another $8 billion in a NAND production facility in Xi'an.,The investment could allow Samsung to improve production of its NAND flash; it could also be an attempt by the company to curry favor with the Chinese government as it , to foreign technology companies.,Either way, the additional investment might seem odd, given that Samsung's quarterly revenues declined , year-over-year for all of 2019. Those drops were largely attributed to the memory market's continued pricing woes.,Samsung previously said it would , in an effort to keep pricing stable. That was in September 2018--the market's decline throughout 2019 shows how well that strategy worked. (Which is to say that, in many ways, it didn't.),The company's also , in the NAND market. Yangtze Memory Technologies, a China-based company, reportedly started volume production of 64-layer 3D NAND in September with plans to increase output in 2020.,Which means a company whose quarterly revenues have been halved for the last year because of declining memory prices that's facing increased competition--which could drive prices even further down--is investing $8 billion into a production facility.,And that's after the initial $10.8 billion investment as well as an additional $7 billion invested in 2017. Regardless of the motivation, that investment shows that Samsung isn't too concerned about the memory market, or at least does a good job hiding it."
Adata Shipped Black-Friday Shoppers a Slower-Model SSD Than They Ordered,"You don't always get what you pay for. Customers who ordered an Adata XPG SX8200 Pro (1TB) SSD from Rakuten during the Black Friday weekend have been receiving the slightly-slower, SX8100 drive instead,The Adata XPG SX8200 Pro is one of the fastest M.2 NVMe SSDs on the market and the best value or the money when compared to pricier competitors like ,. It normally goes for around $147 so when Rakuten had it for $106, many enthusiasts pulled the trigger. ,In a ,/ subreddit, a number of users reported receiving the inferior drive, shortly after getting an email from Adata  (via Rakuten) stating that the company's shipment of SX8200 Pro drives was delayed and that it was substituting an SX8100.,The text read:,Though users ordered their drives through Rakuten, the orders were fulfilled directly by Adata, the SSD's manufacturer. The text of the email states that Adata had tried contacting the customer in a prior message to ask if they would like a refund and since the company received no reply, it shipped out the SX8100 instead. ,However, users on the Reddit forum and several who contacted Tom's Hardware directly said that they had received no prior email from Adata or Rakuten. Some customers told us that they had received no emails at all prior to getting the SX8100 in the mail. ,Adding to the confusion just a little bit: a label on the outside of the shipping box read ""ASX8200PNP,"" while the package inside was correctly marked as the SX8100. ,We spoke with Adata Marketing Manager Chris Kuo who admitted that the company hadn't managed its inventory well, resulting in the shortage, and described the controversy as a learning experience that would change how it handles similar issues in the future. She insisted that all consumers were sent an initial email offering them the opportunity to either wait for the SX8200 Pro to come in stock, get a refund or receive the SX8100 instead. If the company received a response, she noted, the consumer's wishes were followed.,The packaging carried SX8200 Pro labels on the outside, she noted, because the boxes were stickered before they were packed and before the decision was made to put the substitute products in.,""This is a lesson learned for us,"" Kuo said. ""Next time we will ship out replacements to those customers who reply and directly cancel the orders for those who do not reply."",She said that the company is very concerned about its customers' satisfaction and will, as it states in the email, allow anyone who received the SX8100 to send it back and receive an SX8200 Pro when it becomes available next week.  Kuo said that the company is providing free shipping labels for customers to send the SX8100 drives back.,Consumers who bought the XPG SX8200 Pro through Amazon were not affected, because Amazon fulfilled those orders and, according to Kuo, had adequate stock.,We also reached out to Rakuten for comment. The online marketplace said that it was aware of the problem with Adata's inventory and that it fully expected the company to replace the SX8100 units with SX8200 Pro models.,""If a customer who received an 8100 in error hasn’t heard from ADATA already, they should receive an email from them shortly about their plans to replace or refund it,"" Rakuten said in a statement. ""ADATA has assured us that that they plan to replace customers expecting 8200s with the correct units when they are back in stock and that they can continue to use the 8100s while they wait."",Besides just wanting exactly the model they paid for, there's a good reason that customers would prefer an XPG SX8200 Pro over the SX8100. The top pick on our , page, the Adata XPG SX8200 Pro uses an SMI SM2262EN controller that has a 1GB DRAM cache as opposed to the Realtek RTS5762 which has a ""partial DRAM"" cache of an unspecified amount. ,The XPG SX8200 Pro has a rated sequential read/write rate of 3,500 and 3,000 MBps respectively with random read and write IOPS of 390,000 and 380,000 IOPS. By contrast, the XPG SX8100 has the same rated read and write rates, but read/write IOPS of 290,000 / 240,000.,Except that the latter has a heat spreader, the XPG SX8100 is nearly-identical to the XPG Spectrix s40G, which we are in the process of reviewing. On most tests, the XPG SX8200 Pro scored better.,For example, on Diskbench, the XPG SX8200 Pro has a transfer rate of 887 MBps as compared to 678 MBps with the Spectrix S40G. The SX8200 Pro also loaded a level of Final Fantasy XIV in 18.6 seconds, one second faster than the Spectrix S40G.,If you're a customer who ordered an SX8200 Pro from Rakuten but received an SX8100, you should have received an email from Adata telling you how to send it back for either a refund or an SX8200 Pro. However, if you haven't heard from Adata, you can contact Rakuten by emailing , or calling ,Kuo said that Adata is working with Rakuten to get customer's phone numbers so that, if a similar situation arises in the future, the company will be able to call people who don't answer via email.,Unfortunately for Adata, even sending the correct SSD may not restore trust.,""The communication was bad and the entire idea of sending a customer lower quality product because the one they ordered is out of stock is ridiculous,"" said Adam Miller, a consumer who ordered the XPG SX8200 Pro from Rakuten on November 28th. ""I won't be shopping their products again and I hope I can get this issue resolved in a timely manner. The worst part is that there will undoubtedly be customers who don't catch the switch and will be stuck with a product they didn't even want."""
"Lexar’s New NVMe SSD Hits 7GBps, the Fastest yet for a PCIe 4.0 SSD","The latest consumer PCIe 4.0 x4 NVMe SSDs are all built using Phison’s PS5016-E16 NVMe controller. With sequential performance speeds of up to 5 GBps, they are much faster than your standard PCIe 3.0 x4 NVMe SSD. And if you are in the market for speed, they are currently the drives to get, but ,, they will soon face stiff competition from Lexar.,Lexar showcased a PCIe 4.0 x4 NVMe SSD prototype that it will release in Q2 2020. Lexar hasn’t branded the drive yet, so it doesn’t have a name. However, the company says the drive should be able to reach speeds of 7GBps of sequential read and 4GBps of write throughput.,Lexar demoed the SSD reaching just over 6.2/4.2 GBps of read/write throughput in a Crystal Diskmark test. Later, the company tested with Iometer and revealed the drive could dish out over 7.5 Gbps of sequential read throughput.,Lexar didn’t divulge specifics about the components powering the device, but performance seems similar to Phison’s soon-to-be-released E18 SSD controller that is built on a 12nm process and supports the NVMe 1.4 protocol. We do know the drive will come with LDPC ECC to protect data integrity and boost endurance. Lexar paired the controller to the latest 96L 3D TLC flash; however, it didn’t specify the vendor.  ,Overall, the drive seems quite similar to what we expect from the next-gen Phison controllers, but the company hasn’t confirmed. Rather, it mentioned that it is not running an SSD controller from a well-known brand like Marvell, Phison, or Silicon Motion. ,Size-wise, the SSD will come in an M.2 2280 form factor and feature a heatsink to keep things cool. The model on display comes with a green PCB, which completely clashes with the motherboard’s black and grey theme. Hopefully, Lexar will opt for a black PCB on the final product to make the drive more appealing to enthusiasts."
"Seagate's Mach.2 Technology Doubles HDD Performance, Microsoft Jumps Aboard","Seagate's multi-actuator technology is a simple concept that doubles the performance of a hard drive by using two actuators, and the idea certainly isn't new. In fact, the company has already developed drives with multiple actuators in the past, but they weren't economically viable due to higher component costs.,Now the company has perfected the method to effectively double HDD performance, ,, and devices are in the wild. ,In every cloud data center, floor space is at a premium, and for many applications, cloud providers are trying to get more IOPS out of the same slot. The 14TB Exos 2X14 connects over SAS and presents itself to a server as two 7TB volumes rather than as a single drive. With two actuators, IOs can transfer independently of each other within a single HDD. One actuator addresses the top half of the drive, while the other actuator services the bottom half.,At lower costs per GB and high capacities, HDDs are a good choice for applications such as content delivery networks (CDNs), video streaming, mail servers, backup/shuttle services, Hadoop, and other cloud applications.,But, as capacity increases, performance needs to scale as well. Traditional single actuator HDDs just aren’t cutting it. That’s why Seagate’s Exos 2X14 enterprise hard drive features the company’s MACH.2 dual-actuator technology, and Microsoft has jumped in as an early adopter.,Seagate partnered with Microsoft architect Aaron Ogus deployed the technology in the Microsoft Cloud space and worked on Exos 2X14’s development directly from its infancy.,Seagate’s 14TB Exos 2X14 enterprise hard drive is the first to feature the company’s MACH.2 multi-actuator technology, and Microsoft has just finished initial testing.,To support all of Microsoft’s CSP services including Azure and Exchange, the company will deploy Seagate’s new Exos MACH.2 drives. The company took a look at interoperability and compatibility with the data center infrastructure as well as robustness, reliability, and ease of integration with its Project Olympus system architecture. Of course, performance factored in.,To evaluate sequential performance, Microsoft simulated backup and streaming operations. The company also simulated hyperscale and CDN workloads for testing random read IOPS and used Microsoft Exchange Server Jetstress tool to simulate Exchange 2013 and Exchange 2016 disk I/O loads.,“Based upon that analysis, we’ve found we are getting close to twice the throughput and IOPS, which are the improvements we expected to achieve with the MACH.2 technology,” says Ogus.,Seagate cloud product manager, James Borden, explains that “to maintain the expected quality of service, a 16TB drive requires twice the maximum throughput capability of an 8TB drive. As your application starts to exceed the maximum IOPS capability of a storage device, the only way to solve that is to put less data on the device — and that equates to stranded capacity.”,Borden explains that, when short stroking, “You put a subset of your data on the outer diameter of a drive and use the internal diameter to store less important data that doesn't need to be delivered with the same quality-of-service metric. In that way, at least you won't have a hard drive that's only two-thirds full. But short stroking still makes data management more complex, and you can’t be certain you’ll always have full utilization of your installed capacity.”,Seagate’s MACH.2 technology boosts the performance Microsoft needs to support their exchange servers at higher capacities to prevent this from happening. It also removes the need to short stroke your storage to improve performance, too.,The Exos MACH.2 HDDs will be available in multiple SKUs to accommodate applicable enterprise use cases as collaboration and development continue, but Seagate hasn't given specifics about when it will open the drives up to the broader market. "

Patriot Launches Viper VPR100 M.2 PCIe 3.0 x4 SSD,"Patriot has announced the brand's latest Viper VPR100 product line that features capacities from 256GB up to 2TB. The VPR100 promises to deliver uncompromised storage speed and performance while also adding some bling-bling to your build.,The VPR100 adheres to the M.2 2280 form factor and utilizes a standard PCIe 3.0 x4 interface. The SSD shows up with a low-profile, military-grade aluminum heatsink decked out with RGB lighting. Patriot even added an external thermal sensor to the SSD to monitor the drive's internal operating temperatures to prevent overheating. ,What makes the VPR100's lighting unique is that you can personalize it to your liking through the included Viper RGB software. There are five customizable lighting profiles and eight pre-programmed RGB lighting patterns to choose from. Additionally, the VPR100's lighting is compatible with many motherboard ecosystems, including Asus Aura Sync, Gigabyte RGB Fusion, MSI Mystic Light Sync, and ASRock Polychrome Sync.,Patriot notes that using RGB sync could decrease the drive's performance between 20% to 30% depending on the RGB mode selected.,Underneath the VPR100, you'll find a 10-layer PCB that houses Phison's E12 SSD controller. Patriot doesn't specify the type of NAND it uses for the VPR100. The 256GB and 512GB models feature a 512GB DRAM cache while the 1TB and 2TB models come with DRAM cache sizes that match their capacities.,The VPR100 delivers sequential read speeds up to 3,300 MB/s across all capacities. The 256GB and 512GB variants offer sequential write speeds up to 1,000 MB/s and 2,100 MBs, respectively, while the other remaining variants boast speeds up to 2,900 MB/s. ,In terms of random performance, the 256GB drive features 300,000 IOPS reads and 250,000 IOPS writes and the 512GB drive offers 700,000 IOPS reads and 400,000 IOPS writes. As for the 1TB and 2TB models, both come with random read and write speeds of 700,000 IOPS and 650,000 IOPS, respectively.,The 256GB, 512GB, 1TB and 2TB drives are rated with an endurance of 300 TBW, 800 TBW, 1,600 TBW and 3,115 TBW, respectively. The VPR100 is backed with a limited five-year warranty.,The VPR100 256GB and 512GB models should be available on Amazon soon for , and ,, respectively. The 1TB model costs , while the 2TB will set you back ,."
WD Introduces Blue SN550 M.2 SSDs up to 1TB,"WD released the next generation of its Blue SSD, the SN550, today. The SN550 looks to be a nice improvement over the SN500. This time around, the company purpose-built the SSD for content creators and PC enthusiasts looking for both responsive performance and efficiency.,Forward Insights predicts that NVMe devices will account for more than 75 percent of storage shipped in the PC segment by 2021. And, with prices dropping lower than ever, we think we know why. This has brought down 1TB-class SSDs to a very affordable level, making it a hot capacity point. So hot that WD has already refreshed the months old Blue SN500, which only came in 250GB and 500GB capacities, with a replacement that goes up to 1TB.  ,The hardware and firmware changes driving this improved performance involve an updated controller with a PCIe 3.0 x4 interface, a jump forward from just two lanes. The company also infused the latest 96-Layer TLC flash into its design but didn't share further details.,At its core, WD’s SN550 features a DRAMless architecture, which helps keep production costs down. Unlike what we’ve experienced with some SSDs in the past, though, that didn’t hinder the SN500’s performance too much. We’re not sure if the company leverages the host memory buffer spec in this new release, but performance and endurance look pretty competitive.,The drive comes in a slim M.2 2280 single-sided form factor, and the company claims that it features improved thermal performance to keep up with sustained workloads. That's great for those who work with large files like 4K/8K video, or any prosumer-class applications.,The new SN550 will deliver even faster performance of up to 2.4 GBps read, which is four times faster than SATA SSDs. WD rates write performance up to 1.95 GBps, and random performance is more than enough for consumer workloads at over 400,000 read/write IOPS. Endurance ratings match WD’s Black NS750 as well as Samsung’s 970 EVO Plus, and the SN550 comes with a matching five-year warranty.,At price points of $54.99, $64.99, and $99.99 per respective capacity, the SN550 should offer a responsive user experience and greater value over the last-gen model. Stay tuned for our review; samples are inbound."
