Xbox Series X Pics & SSD Specs Appear: Here's What We Know,"Specifications for Microsoft’s next console, Xbox Series X (also known by codename Project Scarlett) are slowly coming out. We already know that it will ,an,, along with a ""next-gen"" AMD , that will pack hardware-based ,. We've also known for a while that the new Xbox will pack a great new ,, but up until today the details have remained somewhat scarce.,More information has also surfaced about the console's rear I/O.,At CES, AMD showed a render of the Xbox Series X during its keynote, which showed the console's rear I/O connectivity. This got many of us excited, however, ,. It was made using a 3D model from TurboSquid, and we also suspected that the connectivity shown wasn't representative of the end product. ,Fast forward two weeks to today, and it looks like Twitter user , posted two pictures of an Xbox Series X prototype on the NeoGAF forums, corroborated by ,.,Although this is still a prototype (as  indicated on the unit), these images are interesting for two main reasons: we get to see the connectivity, and they're images of the actual hardware, not renders.,As far as the connectivity goes, there's an HDMI port, SPDIF optical audio port, power, Ethernet, and two USB SuperSpeed ports. The front of the unit has an additional USB port.,
What's notable is the single HDMI port. On the Xbox One, Microsoft had both HDMI-in and HDMI-out. The HDMI-in would let you route devices like a cable box through the console, which would be the one device connected to a television. It appears Microsoft is considering abandoning that approach.,We can only speculate that the new Xbox will feature HDMI 2.1, because if it doesn't, it won't be able to meet Microsoft's promise of ,fps. Naturally, HDMI 2.1 would also add support for VRR (Variable Refresh Rate).,A few days back a report from Digitimes claimed that the ,, though it wasn't clear exactly which controller Microsoft would end up selecting for the new console. At the time, the Phison E16 was the obvious choice, but we also knew that Phison has the E18 controller in the pipeline, which could offer an alternative option.,
,
Nevertheless, a new rumor from the LinkedIn profile of an unknown software engineer. appears to point towards the use of a DRAM-Less Phison E19 controller that is engineered for use in consoles, cameras, tablets and more. ,The profile as was spotted by , and ,.,Despite the E19 controller's higher name designation than the E16 controller, it looks like the E19 won't reach the 7 GB/s throughput that the E16 is capable of. Instead, it has a maximum read speed of 3.7 GB/s and peak write speeds of 3.0 GB/s. Of course, these figures are no surprise as the previously reported 7 GB/s would be quite excessive for a gaming console.,Although Phison's infographic shows that the controller can deal with up to 2TB worth of NAND memory, ,, though there would also be a lighter 512GB option. Given that today's games can easily exceed 50GB in their installation size, these capacities wouldn't be surprising. These large SSDs in the new consoles are even expected to gobble up as much as 5 percent of the SSD shipments in 2020.,There is a ,, hence the name Xbox ,It is possible that these rumored high-end specifications are for a top-end version of Xbox Series X (if there will be more than one), and that the lower-spec model is aimed at only playing games at 1080p, while also streaming games and media. "
Samsung Reportedly Invests $8B More in China Plant,"Samsung is betting on China. Reuters, citing Chinese state media, today said the company , another $8 billion in a NAND production facility in Xi'an.,The investment could allow Samsung to improve production of its NAND flash; it could also be an attempt by the company to curry favor with the Chinese government as it , to foreign technology companies.,Either way, the additional investment might seem odd, given that Samsung's quarterly revenues declined , year-over-year for all of 2019. Those drops were largely attributed to the memory market's continued pricing woes.,Samsung previously said it would , in an effort to keep pricing stable. That was in September 2018--the market's decline throughout 2019 shows how well that strategy worked. (Which is to say that, in many ways, it didn't.),The company's also , in the NAND market. Yangtze Memory Technologies, a China-based company, reportedly started volume production of 64-layer 3D NAND in September with plans to increase output in 2020.,Which means a company whose quarterly revenues have been halved for the last year because of declining memory prices that's facing increased competition--which could drive prices even further down--is investing $8 billion into a production facility.,And that's after the initial $10.8 billion investment as well as an additional $7 billion invested in 2017. Regardless of the motivation, that investment shows that Samsung isn't too concerned about the memory market, or at least does a good job hiding it."
Adata Shipped Black-Friday Shoppers a Slower-Model SSD Than They Ordered,"You don't always get what you pay for. Customers who ordered an Adata XPG SX8200 Pro (1TB) SSD from Rakuten during the Black Friday weekend have been receiving the slightly-slower, SX8100 drive instead,The Adata XPG SX8200 Pro is one of the fastest M.2 NVMe SSDs on the market and the best value or the money when compared to pricier competitors like ,. It normally goes for around $147 so when Rakuten had it for $106, many enthusiasts pulled the trigger. ,In a ,/ subreddit, a number of users reported receiving the inferior drive, shortly after getting an email from Adata  (via Rakuten) stating that the company's shipment of SX8200 Pro drives was delayed and that it was substituting an SX8100.,The text read:,Though users ordered their drives through Rakuten, the orders were fulfilled directly by Adata, the SSD's manufacturer. The text of the email states that Adata had tried contacting the customer in a prior message to ask if they would like a refund and since the company received no reply, it shipped out the SX8100 instead. ,However, users on the Reddit forum and several who contacted Tom's Hardware directly said that they had received no prior email from Adata or Rakuten. Some customers told us that they had received no emails at all prior to getting the SX8100 in the mail. ,Adding to the confusion just a little bit: a label on the outside of the shipping box read ""ASX8200PNP,"" while the package inside was correctly marked as the SX8100. ,We spoke with Adata Marketing Manager Chris Kuo who admitted that the company hadn't managed its inventory well, resulting in the shortage, and described the controversy as a learning experience that would change how it handles similar issues in the future. She insisted that all consumers were sent an initial email offering them the opportunity to either wait for the SX8200 Pro to come in stock, get a refund or receive the SX8100 instead. If the company received a response, she noted, the consumer's wishes were followed.,The packaging carried SX8200 Pro labels on the outside, she noted, because the boxes were stickered before they were packed and before the decision was made to put the substitute products in.,""This is a lesson learned for us,"" Kuo said. ""Next time we will ship out replacements to those customers who reply and directly cancel the orders for those who do not reply."",She said that the company is very concerned about its customers' satisfaction and will, as it states in the email, allow anyone who received the SX8100 to send it back and receive an SX8200 Pro when it becomes available next week.  Kuo said that the company is providing free shipping labels for customers to send the SX8100 drives back.,Consumers who bought the XPG SX8200 Pro through Amazon were not affected, because Amazon fulfilled those orders and, according to Kuo, had adequate stock.,We also reached out to Rakuten for comment. The online marketplace said that it was aware of the problem with Adata's inventory and that it fully expected the company to replace the SX8100 units with SX8200 Pro models.,""If a customer who received an 8100 in error hasn’t heard from ADATA already, they should receive an email from them shortly about their plans to replace or refund it,"" Rakuten said in a statement. ""ADATA has assured us that that they plan to replace customers expecting 8200s with the correct units when they are back in stock and that they can continue to use the 8100s while they wait."",Besides just wanting exactly the model they paid for, there's a good reason that customers would prefer an XPG SX8200 Pro over the SX8100. The top pick on our , page, the Adata XPG SX8200 Pro uses an SMI SM2262EN controller that has a 1GB DRAM cache as opposed to the Realtek RTS5762 which has a ""partial DRAM"" cache of an unspecified amount. ,The XPG SX8200 Pro has a rated sequential read/write rate of 3,500 and 3,000 MBps respectively with random read and write IOPS of 390,000 and 380,000 IOPS. By contrast, the XPG SX8100 has the same rated read and write rates, but read/write IOPS of 290,000 / 240,000.,Except that the latter has a heat spreader, the XPG SX8100 is nearly-identical to the XPG Spectrix s40G, which we are in the process of reviewing. On most tests, the XPG SX8200 Pro scored better.,For example, on Diskbench, the XPG SX8200 Pro has a transfer rate of 887 MBps as compared to 678 MBps with the Spectrix S40G. The SX8200 Pro also loaded a level of Final Fantasy XIV in 18.6 seconds, one second faster than the Spectrix S40G.,If you're a customer who ordered an SX8200 Pro from Rakuten but received an SX8100, you should have received an email from Adata telling you how to send it back for either a refund or an SX8200 Pro. However, if you haven't heard from Adata, you can contact Rakuten by emailing , or calling ,Kuo said that Adata is working with Rakuten to get customer's phone numbers so that, if a similar situation arises in the future, the company will be able to call people who don't answer via email.,Unfortunately for Adata, even sending the correct SSD may not restore trust.,""The communication was bad and the entire idea of sending a customer lower quality product because the one they ordered is out of stock is ridiculous,"" said Adam Miller, a consumer who ordered the XPG SX8200 Pro from Rakuten on November 28th. ""I won't be shopping their products again and I hope I can get this issue resolved in a timely manner. The worst part is that there will undoubtedly be customers who don't catch the switch and will be stuck with a product they didn't even want."""
"Lexar’s New NVMe SSD Hits 7GBps, the Fastest yet for a PCIe 4.0 SSD","The latest consumer PCIe 4.0 x4 NVMe SSDs are all built using Phison’s PS5016-E16 NVMe controller. With sequential performance speeds of up to 5 GBps, they are much faster than your standard PCIe 3.0 x4 NVMe SSD. And if you are in the market for speed, they are currently the drives to get, but ,, they will soon face stiff competition from Lexar.,Lexar showcased a PCIe 4.0 x4 NVMe SSD prototype that it will release in Q2 2020. Lexar hasn’t branded the drive yet, so it doesn’t have a name. However, the company says the drive should be able to reach speeds of 7GBps of sequential read and 4GBps of write throughput.,Lexar demoed the SSD reaching just over 6.2/4.2 GBps of read/write throughput in a Crystal Diskmark test. Later, the company tested with Iometer and revealed the drive could dish out over 7.5 Gbps of sequential read throughput.,Lexar didn’t divulge specifics about the components powering the device, but performance seems similar to Phison’s soon-to-be-released E18 SSD controller that is built on a 12nm process and supports the NVMe 1.4 protocol. We do know the drive will come with LDPC ECC to protect data integrity and boost endurance. Lexar paired the controller to the latest 96L 3D TLC flash; however, it didn’t specify the vendor.  ,Overall, the drive seems quite similar to what we expect from the next-gen Phison controllers, but the company hasn’t confirmed. Rather, it mentioned that it is not running an SSD controller from a well-known brand like Marvell, Phison, or Silicon Motion. ,Size-wise, the SSD will come in an M.2 2280 form factor and feature a heatsink to keep things cool. The model on display comes with a green PCB, which completely clashes with the motherboard’s black and grey theme. Hopefully, Lexar will opt for a black PCB on the final product to make the drive more appealing to enthusiasts."
"Seagate's Mach.2 Technology Doubles HDD Performance, Microsoft Jumps Aboard","Seagate's multi-actuator technology is a simple concept that doubles the performance of a hard drive by using two actuators, and the idea certainly isn't new. In fact, the company has already developed drives with multiple actuators in the past, but they weren't economically viable due to higher component costs.,Now the company has perfected the method to effectively double HDD performance, ,, and devices are in the wild. ,In every cloud data center, floor space is at a premium, and for many applications, cloud providers are trying to get more IOPS out of the same slot. The 14TB Exos 2X14 connects over SAS and presents itself to a server as two 7TB volumes rather than as a single drive. With two actuators, IOs can transfer independently of each other within a single HDD. One actuator addresses the top half of the drive, while the other actuator services the bottom half.,At lower costs per GB and high capacities, HDDs are a good choice for applications such as content delivery networks (CDNs), video streaming, mail servers, backup/shuttle services, Hadoop, and other cloud applications.,But, as capacity increases, performance needs to scale as well. Traditional single actuator HDDs just aren’t cutting it. That’s why Seagate’s Exos 2X14 enterprise hard drive features the company’s MACH.2 dual-actuator technology, and Microsoft has jumped in as an early adopter.,Seagate partnered with Microsoft architect Aaron Ogus deployed the technology in the Microsoft Cloud space and worked on Exos 2X14’s development directly from its infancy.,Seagate’s 14TB Exos 2X14 enterprise hard drive is the first to feature the company’s MACH.2 multi-actuator technology, and Microsoft has just finished initial testing.,To support all of Microsoft’s CSP services including Azure and Exchange, the company will deploy Seagate’s new Exos MACH.2 drives. The company took a look at interoperability and compatibility with the data center infrastructure as well as robustness, reliability, and ease of integration with its Project Olympus system architecture. Of course, performance factored in.,To evaluate sequential performance, Microsoft simulated backup and streaming operations. The company also simulated hyperscale and CDN workloads for testing random read IOPS and used Microsoft Exchange Server Jetstress tool to simulate Exchange 2013 and Exchange 2016 disk I/O loads.,“Based upon that analysis, we’ve found we are getting close to twice the throughput and IOPS, which are the improvements we expected to achieve with the MACH.2 technology,” says Ogus.,Seagate cloud product manager, James Borden, explains that “to maintain the expected quality of service, a 16TB drive requires twice the maximum throughput capability of an 8TB drive. As your application starts to exceed the maximum IOPS capability of a storage device, the only way to solve that is to put less data on the device — and that equates to stranded capacity.”,Borden explains that, when short stroking, “You put a subset of your data on the outer diameter of a drive and use the internal diameter to store less important data that doesn't need to be delivered with the same quality-of-service metric. In that way, at least you won't have a hard drive that's only two-thirds full. But short stroking still makes data management more complex, and you can’t be certain you’ll always have full utilization of your installed capacity.”,Seagate’s MACH.2 technology boosts the performance Microsoft needs to support their exchange servers at higher capacities to prevent this from happening. It also removes the need to short stroke your storage to improve performance, too.,The Exos MACH.2 HDDs will be available in multiple SKUs to accommodate applicable enterprise use cases as collaboration and development continue, but Seagate hasn't given specifics about when it will open the drives up to the broader market. "

Patriot Launches Viper VPR100 M.2 PCIe 3.0 x4 SSD,"Patriot has announced the brand's latest Viper VPR100 product line that features capacities from 256GB up to 2TB. The VPR100 promises to deliver uncompromised storage speed and performance while also adding some bling-bling to your build.,The VPR100 adheres to the M.2 2280 form factor and utilizes a standard PCIe 3.0 x4 interface. The SSD shows up with a low-profile, military-grade aluminum heatsink decked out with RGB lighting. Patriot even added an external thermal sensor to the SSD to monitor the drive's internal operating temperatures to prevent overheating. ,What makes the VPR100's lighting unique is that you can personalize it to your liking through the included Viper RGB software. There are five customizable lighting profiles and eight pre-programmed RGB lighting patterns to choose from. Additionally, the VPR100's lighting is compatible with many motherboard ecosystems, including Asus Aura Sync, Gigabyte RGB Fusion, MSI Mystic Light Sync, and ASRock Polychrome Sync.,Patriot notes that using RGB sync could decrease the drive's performance between 20% to 30% depending on the RGB mode selected.,Underneath the VPR100, you'll find a 10-layer PCB that houses Phison's E12 SSD controller. Patriot doesn't specify the type of NAND it uses for the VPR100. The 256GB and 512GB models feature a 512GB DRAM cache while the 1TB and 2TB models come with DRAM cache sizes that match their capacities.,The VPR100 delivers sequential read speeds up to 3,300 MB/s across all capacities. The 256GB and 512GB variants offer sequential write speeds up to 1,000 MB/s and 2,100 MBs, respectively, while the other remaining variants boast speeds up to 2,900 MB/s. ,In terms of random performance, the 256GB drive features 300,000 IOPS reads and 250,000 IOPS writes and the 512GB drive offers 700,000 IOPS reads and 400,000 IOPS writes. As for the 1TB and 2TB models, both come with random read and write speeds of 700,000 IOPS and 650,000 IOPS, respectively.,The 256GB, 512GB, 1TB and 2TB drives are rated with an endurance of 300 TBW, 800 TBW, 1,600 TBW and 3,115 TBW, respectively. The VPR100 is backed with a limited five-year warranty.,The VPR100 256GB and 512GB models should be available on Amazon soon for , and ,, respectively.

WD Introduces Blue SN550 M.2 SSDs up to 1TB,"WD released the next generation of its Blue SSD, the SN550, today. The SN550 looks to be a nice improvement over the SN500. This time around, the company purpose-built the SSD for content creators and PC enthusiasts looking for both responsive performance and efficiency.,Forward Insights predicts that NVMe devices will account for more than 75 percent of storage shipped in the PC segment by 2021. And, with prices dropping lower than ever, we think we know why. This has brought down 1TB-class SSDs to a very affordable level, making it a hot capacity point. So hot that WD has already refreshed the months old Blue SN500, which only came in 250GB and 500GB capacities, with a replacement that goes up to 1TB.  ,The hardware and firmware changes driving this improved performance involve an updated controller with a PCIe 3.0 x4 interface, a jump forward from just two lanes. The company also infused the latest 96-Layer TLC flash into its design but didn't share further details.,At its core, WD’s SN550 features a DRAMless architecture, which helps keep production costs down. Unlike what we’ve experienced with some SSDs in the past, though, that didn’t hinder the SN500’s performance too much. We’re not sure if the company leverages the host memory buffer spec in this new release, but performance and endurance look pretty competitive.,The drive comes in a slim M.2 2280 single-sided form factor, and the company claims that it features improved thermal performance to keep up with sustained workloads. That's great for those who work with large files like 4K/8K video, or any prosumer-class applications.,The new SN550 will deliver even faster performance of up to 2.4 GBps read, which is four times faster than SATA SSDs. WD rates write performance up to 1.95 GBps, and random performance is more than enough for consumer workloads at over 400,000 read/write IOPS. Endurance ratings match WD’s Black NS750 as well as Samsung’s 970 EVO Plus, and the SN550 comes with a matching five-year warranty.,At price points of $54.99, $64.99, and $99.99 per respective capacity, the SN550 should offer a responsive user experience and greater value over the last-gen model. Stay tuned for our review; samples are inbound."

Kioxia Unveils Potential Successor to QLC NAND Flash,"Kioxia (formerly Toshiba Memory) has developed a new technology to increase the storage density of flash memory called Twin BiCS Flash. The technology, announced Thursday, essentially allows memory chips to have smaller cells and more bits per cell, both of which can lead to increased memory density. ,The Twin BiCS Flash is a candidate for 3D NAND flash drives with more than four bits per cell (aka QLC). The company gave us some hints about the technology for the first time at the Flash Memory Summit 2019 in August, when it presented its “halved memory cell” technology for denser 3D NAND drive. Kioxia was still called Toshiba Memory at the time.,On Thursday, Kioxia publicly announced the world’s first “three-dimensional semicircular split-gate flash memory cell structure."" The Twin BiCS Flash name coincides with another technology Kioxia currently develops and manufactures with partner Western Digital, BiCS Flash.,Unlike BiCS Flash, which uses a circular charge trap cells (CT), the new Twin BiCS Flash uses semi-circular floating gate cells (FG). The new structure enlarges the window for programming the cell, even though the cells are smaller than with CT technology. This makes the technology quite a promising candidate to succeed the QLC NAND technology, although it’s not clear yet if it will become penta-level cell (PLC) technology or something else.,Normally there are three ways to increase NAND flash density. ,One is to increase the memory layers. We’ve recently passed 96-layer NAND flash chips and achieved 128-bit NAND flash chips. Manufacturers are already envisioning 500 and 800-layer NAND chips in the future.,Another is to increase the bits per cell, which has given us SLC, MLC, TLC and, more recently, QLC NAND, with each one increasing the number of bits per cell by one compared to the previous technology (usually with a trade-off in reliability). ,And the third is to decrease the cell size so that more cells can fit in a single layer.,Kioxia’s Twin BiCS Flash technology focuses on the latter two, as the company believes that as we pass over 100 NAND memory layers there are diminishing returns from increasing the number of layers with each generation. The trade-offs look less and less appealing compared to the other two ways to increase density, according to Kioxia.,The company said in in its announcement,""3D flash memory technology has achieved high bit density with low cost per bit by increasing the number of cell stacked layers as well as by implementing multilayer stack deposition and high aspect ratio etching. In recent years, as the number of cell layers exceeds 100, managing the trade-offs among etch profile control, size uniformity and productivity is becoming increasingly challenging. To overcome this problem, Kioxia developed a new semicircular cell design by splitting the gate electrode in the conventional circular cell to reduce cell size compared to the conventional circular cell, enabling higher-density memory at a lower number of cell layers."",Twin BiCS Flash is still years away from implementation and very much in the research and development phase. ,Kioxia is now preparing its launch of BiCS5 128-layer NAND flash chips in 2020. Both SK Hynix and Samsung were able to pass the 100-layer milestone earlier this year, with the 128-layer 4D NAND and V-NAND v6, respectively."

SK Hynix to Introduce New NVMe SSDs With 128-Layer '4D NAND',"At CES 2020, the Korean semiconductor company SK Hynix Inc plans to expand the company’s reach in the consumer market. SK Hynix will have its latest SSDs, the Gold P31 and Platinum P31 PCIe NVMe SSDs, on display.,SK Hynix has been a major supplier of components to various OEM computer manufacturers over the past decade, but the recent release of the SuperCore series Gold S31, a SATA SSD, marked the company’s entrance into the consumer market in the USA.,The company will introduce two new PCIe NVMe SSDs into the mix that cater to those seeking higher performance for gaming and multimedia editing workflows. Both drives are built using the company’s latest 128-Layer '4D NAND' flash. The new flash is making its way to market rather quickly, as SK Hynix just ,.,SK hynix didn't reveal any further details about the SSDs, though. The company designs and manufactures DRAM, NAND, and SSD controllers in-house, giving it an edge over many of its competitors that use off-the-shelf components. Considering the company manufactures DRAM, it is unlikely that the SSD controller design will lack a cache, but we are still waiting for feedback on specifics.,If you are attending the CES and want a first-hand look at the new Gold P31 and Platinum P31 PCIe SSDs, stop by SK Hynix’s booth (#13529) in the Las Vegas Convention Center’s Central LLCC Hall."
Seagate Launches FireCuda Gaming and BarraCuda Fast SSDs,"Seagate launched two new high-performance external SSDs for gamers on the go, the FireCuda Gaming SSD and BarraCuda Fast SSD. Both boast the latest USB-C interface, but, while their ports are common, their performance capability differs greatly.,The fastest of the two, the FireCuda Gaming SSD, is cutting-edge. The company states it is the perfect companion for the recently released FireCuda Gaming Dock. Powered by Seagate’s FireCuda 510, a high-performance NVMe SSD, and coming with a SuperSpeed USB 20Gb/s (USB 3.2 Gen2×2) interface, it can reach top speeds of up to 2 GBps. But, bear in mind that because the FireCuda features an SLC write cache, this high-performance won’t remain so high after you fill the drive with data.,Along with strong performance, it’s got style. It features a chisel metal enclosure and RGB lighting, which you can easily manage with Seagate’s Toolkit software. The device can even sync colors with the FireCuda Gaming Dock, too. It will be available in capacities of 500GB, 1TB, and 2TB in March. MSRPs are $189.99 (500GB), $259.99 (1TB), and $499.99 (2TB) and the drives come with a five-year limited warranty.,Seagate is also launching a new BarraCuda Fast SSD. It is oriented towards mobile gamers and power users. It is slightly smaller, making it a better choice for those on the run. Like the FireCuda Gaming SSD, the BarraCuda Fast SSD features some lighting effect, but instead of RGB, it is a static green light.,It will be available in the same capacities of 500GB, 1TB, and 2TB, too, but offer lower performance at a cheaper price point. Powered by a SATA SSD and USB 3.1 Gen2 Type-C interface, the BarraCuda Fast SSD offers performance figures of up to 540 MBps, putting hard drives to shame. It will be available this February, comes backed by a three-year warranty, and has listed retail MSRPs of $94.99 (500GB), $169.99 (1TB), and $299.99 (2TB).,Additionally, these new SSDs are preformatted with exFAT, and they are both macOS and Windows compatible out of the box. You also get a complimentary subscription to the Adobe Creative Cloud Photography Plan for two months."
"Phison Displays 8TB M.2, 16TB SATA SSDs at CES 2020","Phison announced here at CES 2020 that it has reduced the footprint of its SSD controller to enable incredibly capacious SSDs, like the 8TB M.2 NVMe and 16TB SATA SSDs the company had on display here at CES 2020. The company also demoed a new innovative tiering technique from Enmotus that's infused into some of its latest SSD controllers. ,Phison was the first company to bring a PCIe 4.0 SSD controller to market, and its timing couldn't have worked out better given the arrival of AMD's Ryzen and Threadripper platforms that paved the way for PCIe 4.0-equipped systems. The third-party SSD controller manufacturer has long powered many of the SSDs we see from the big OEMs, like Crucial/Micron, but it also feeds smaller players, like Adata and Kingston, among many others. The company's exclusive PCIe 4.0 support on its SSD controllers pushed the company ahead of many competitors, including OEMs like Samsung and other third-party controller vendors, like SMI. ,Phison is seeing some new competition from relative-newcomer Innogrit, which powers a new ,, and Samsung, which , with the PCIe 4.0 interface here at CES, but Phison is already pushing forward with development of a new controller that will boost its performance, but of equal importance, also repackaged its existing controller to bring about big capacity increases in smaller SSDs.  ,Here we can see Phison's reference design for 8TB NVMe SSDs using the same basic architecture as its proven E12 controller. Phison shrunk the packaging of its E12 SSD controller, even though it still uses the same 28nm manufacturing process, to create the E12S controller that consumes less space on the SSD, which then allows the company to cram in more NAND packages. ,This drive consists of four Micron 96-layer QLC packages on either side of the PCB, for a total of eight emplacements. Each of these packages features eight die that provide a total of 1TB of usable capacity, which then naturally brings us to 8TB of total usable capacity.  ,Phison is bullish on the future of QLC flash for the consumer market, so it is focusing its consumer-facing products heavily on QLC flash, though the company still supports TLC and MLC. As we know, QLC enables these eye-popping densities, but most users won't need 8TB of storage on a single M.2 SSD. To address customers that don't need such high capacities, Phison also has a single-sided reference design that weights in at a 'mere' 4TB. ,The E12S communicates over a PCIe 4.0 x4 connection to provide up to 3,500/3,000 MB/s of sequential read/write throughput and 490,000/680,000 random read/write IOPS. ,Here we see that same philosophy, and NAND, employed to create a massive 16TB SATA SSD. Phison will market this design primarily for NAS SSDs, but will also make it available for SSDs destined for the standard consumer market. ,As with all SATA drives, the bus limits performance. This prototype drive still pulls off 550/530 MB/s of read/write throughput and 95,000/90,000 IOPS of random read/write performance, so it brings impressive performance along with its beefy capacity. ,Phison doesn't produce SSDs for the retail market, instead, its controllers filter out and enable the third-party SSD ecosystem. That means the company doesn't set pricing for end devices, but given that the current going rate for flash is roughly nine cents per GB, the flash for a capacious 16TB model could run roughly $1,500, which is an amazingly cheap theoretical price considering how expensive flash was just a few short years ago. Of course, SSD vendors will charge more for the end devices, which we could see debut within the next few months, due to the price of development and other components, but cheaper QLC flash pricing enables higher densities at the most affordable price points we've seen yet. ,Phison also had a demo with Enmotus's new tiering approach, which is infused directly into the firmware of the SSD, on display in its booth. We're meeting with Enmotus later this week, stay tuned. "
"Intel has PCIe 4.0 Optane SSDs Ready, But Nothing for Customers to Plug Them Into","In an interesting revelation that could give us some insight into how Intel's processor and storage roadmaps converge, even if forcibly, the company's Technical Marketing Performance Engineer Frank Ober , the unannounced information that the Alder Stream next-gen Optane SSDs would support the PCIe Gen 4.0 interface. From what we can glean from the posts, Ober has already sampled the drives to one Linux developer, meaning the drives are likely in the final stages of development, and is actively sampling the drives to others. ,There's only one problem: Intel doesn't have any PCIe 4.0-capable CPUs available on the market for its customers to plug the drives into. ,Intel teased us with its new Alder Stream second-gen Optane SSDs a few months ago but didn't share many details about the new drives. We do know the SSDs will come with second-gen Optane media (,), which is an important step forward for Intel in the wake of its split with its ,.,These initial Optane SSDs are destined for the data center, but this new revelation also gives us an indication of when we can expect to see new PCIe 4.0 Optane SSDs with second-gen , for the consumer market.,Given that Intel doesn’t have any processors (aside from the Stratix 10 FPGAs) that support the PCIe 4.0 interface, the developers obviously don't have access to an Intel-driven test platform with the new interface, so they could be testing with either , or Ryzen processors to use the new drives at their full potential. They could also connect them to Intel platforms with the PCIe 3.0 interface, which should still unlock extra performance from the next-gen SSDs controller and media. ,Given that the drives appear nearly ready for market, that could present a conundrum for Intel as any current sales of its next-gen Optane products would only benefit its rivals (AMD chief among them) that do support the interface and the Optane drives through industry-standard protocols. Logically, that means the company might keep its next-gen Optane products off the market, even if they're ready, until it has processors that support the new faster interface.,According to ,, the company plans to begin production of its PCIe 4.0-equipped 10nm Ice Lake processors in H2 2020, which means we might not see significant volume until several months later. In the interim, Intel will begin production of its 14nm Cooper Lake processors in the first half of 2020, and those chips almost , As a result, it's logical to expect the company to launch the Alder Stream SSDs with the Ice Lake chips in the latter half of 2020 (provided it remains on schedule).,If Intel follows its normal cadence, the consumer desktop SSDs in M.2 and PCIe add-in-card form factors should arrive shortly after the data center models, and that would slot into the expected timeline for Intel's PCIe 4.0-compatible desktop processors.,According to Intel's latest desktop announcements, Tiger Lake (,) lands in 2020, ,. Intel's first PCIe 4.0 chips for the desktop are thought to be ,, which are rumored to arrive in early 2021.,AMD moved forward to PCIe 4.0 last year with the arrival of its EPYC and Ryzen processors for the data center and desktop markets, respectively, giving the company a big advantage in terms of I/O throughput. ,Meanwhile, Intel has been mired on the PCIe 3.0 interface due to its next-gen architectures being locked behind its transition to the 10nm node. The company does plan to make future architectures portable between nodes, but for now, the company doesn’t have any PCIe 4.0-capable chips on the market, and barring any big unexpected announcements this week here at CES 2020, it doesn’t appear the company will support the interface until late 2020 or early 2021.,That’s because supporting PCIe 4.0 on a processor, at least in a meaningful way, isn’t just as simple as bolting on a PCIe 4.0 controller: The internal pathways have to be built to accommodate the increased throughput. There is the odd chance that Intel could support the PCIe 4.0 interface through external means only, such as only through devices connected to the chipset, but that doesn't seem likely. ,In either case, Intel's Alder Stream second-gen Optane drives are apparently ready for sampling to partners, but due to the long qualification cycles in the enterprise, particularly when Intel is plowing ahead with a new media, it will likely be quite a while before the company launches the new drives. Regardless if the drives are ready or not, it's unlikely that Intel would release them before its own PCIe 4.0-capable processors are also ready for launch. "
"Adata Shows Off SSD with 1 Million IOPS, 7,000 MBps Reads","If an M.2 SSD that reads at 3,500 MBps seems a little slow to you, Adata has good news. Here at CES 2020, the company unveiled the XPG Sage, an upcoming PCIe Gen 4 SSD that promises read and write speeds of over 7,000 and 6,000 MBps, along with 1 million / 800K IOPS read and writes. Due out later this year for an undetermined price, the Sage is among the first to use Innogrit's Rainier controller.,At its CES suite, Adata showed some preliminary CrystalDisk results from the Sage. The demo unit managed sequential read and writes of 7,240 and 5,395 MBps respectively. However, an Adata product manager said he expects the write rate to increase to over 6,000 MBps by the time the firmware is finalized.,The Innogrit Rainier (IG5236) controller promises significant speed and IOPS improvements over the Phison E16, the controller found in all the current-gen PCIe 4.0 SSDs. The ,, which uses the E16 controller, is rated for read / writes of 4,950 / 4,250 MBps, about 25 percent less than the Rainier-powered XPG Sage. Additionally Corsair's SSD is rated for only 680,000 / 600,000 IOPS, 30 to 40 percent less than the Sage's 1 million / 800,000 read / write IOPS.,Innogrit is a ,, but the specs on its Rainier IG5236 are impressive. It uses 8 channels, with a 16 / 12nm TSMC FinFET manufacturing process, and can support up to 16TB of storage. The Sage itself will be available in capacities of up to 4TB. ,An Adata representative said that the Sage has a full 4GB of DRAM cache. As part of the XPG gaming line, it will have an attractive heatspreader, but the company didn't have one to show us just yet.,Given the fluctuation in NAND prices, Adata could not share target pricing. A rep did say that we should expect to see the Sage sometime later this year, perhaps around the Computex (May / June) time frame. "
"PS5 and Xbox Series X Specs Point to Higher Demand for SSDs, GDDR6 in 2020","A report from research firm ,this week said that the arrival of the next Xbox and PlayStation consoles will lead to a ""surge"" in demand for SSDs and graphics ,, namely GDDR6, in the second half of 2020. To which extent this surge will affect consumer prices is unclear, but we do know that prices for both ,and ,are already expected to rise in 2020.,""TrendForce expects game consoles to be a new source of SSD demand in the future, taking up as much as 3-5% of total SSD shipment in 2020. This share figure will grow significantly in 2021, with NAND Flash bit consumption from game console SSDs projected to reach 5% of the global total in 2H20,"" DRAMeXchange said in its announcement. ,However, the analyst doesn't expect the consoles to have a big impact on SSD prices, noting that the costs of NAND have been rising due to inventory pressure on the supply side, along with increased demand for ,from PC OEMs and data center customers.,The research organization said that the ,and Xbox Series X's will each pack, SSDs (and rumor has it that the ,) that are either 512GB or 1TB big, depending on the variant you pick.,BOth using AMD GPUs, the DRAM pools are expected to be up to 16GB of GDDR6 for the PS5 and 12 or 16GB of GDDR6 for the Xbox Series X, depending on the variant. Of course, these consoles need to be ready for the future, which means including support for ,and to able to run games at 60 frames per seconds (fps). Still, even by today's , standards, these are huge DRAM pools.,""In comparison to the GDDR5 memory used in PS4 (8GB) and Xbox One X (8/12GB), GDDR6 represents a significant upgrade in terms of performance and density,"" DRAMeXchange said. ""Sony and Microsoft will enter their peak procurement period for components after mid-2020. As well, Nvidia will start offering its new lineup of GPUs based on a new microarchitecture codenamed Ampere in 2H20. These factors are projected to trigger a massive rush to stock up on GDDR6 memory later this year."""
"Xbox Series X SSDs Will be Powered by Phison Controller, Report Claims","According to a ,, Phison has ""reportedly broken into the supply chain of Microsoft's Xbox,"" seemingly confirming industry speculation that the Taiwanese SSD controller vendor had secured a contract to provide components for the highly-anticipated Xbox Series X. ,What does that mean for gamers? The possibility of PCIe 4.0 SSDs that could hit 7 GB/s of throughput and up to 8TB of capacity, though the latter isn't likely because it would be shocking overkill for a console and add quite a bit to the price tag. ,Microsoft has been talking up its new , that comes equipped with an AMD Zen 2-based processor and next-gen GPU that supports hardware-accelerated ray tracing, but also revealed the new console has an ,of current-gen consoles. That marks a big step forward from current consoles, which overwhelmingly come with HDDs that aren't even on the same playing field in terms of performance. ,If newer games are coded to take advantage of the NVMe SSD correctly, that could result in nearly-instantaneous load times and more detailed scenes during gameplay. ,Phison has a big advantage in terms of raw speed. The company produces E16 SSD controllers that third-party SSD vendors use to build the only SSDs on the market that support the PCIe 4.0 interface, giving them access to potentially twice the sequential throughput of any other model currently on the market. The E16's strength in sequential work is important: The faster interface pumps high-quality textures into the processor nearly twice as fast as PCIe 3.0 SSDs (up to 5GB/s), thus enabling richer scenes and smoother gameplay. Phison already has its next-gen E18 SSD controller in the works, too, that will push the bar up to 7GB/s. ,We ,, and the company also had new PCIe 4.0 SSD prototypes that cram an astounding 8TB onto a single M.2 SSD with the E12S controller, so the company is working to make both faster and more capacious SSDs that could all land in the same time frame as Microsoft's Xbox Series X.,It's hard to tell which of Phison's controllers Microsoft will select, but given its statements around performance, it will almost certainly be a PCIe 4.0 variant. Phison was the first to support the interface, which does give it an advantage of having field-tested SSD controllers available for Microsoft. Other SSD/controller vendors do have competing PCIe 4.0 SSDs on the way to market, like Innogrit and Samsung, but those will be relative newcomers while Phison's controllers have been in the market for quite some time. "
Asus Intros a Quad M.2 PCI-Express x16 4.0 Adapter for Very Fast NMVe Storage,"Back in October 2019, amidst the dawn of new sTRX4 motherboards, , to turn a PCI-Express 4.0 x16 slot into four M.2 slots with access to four PCI-E 4.0 lanes each. Now it appears Asus must have thought that wasn't a bad idea, because it's showing off a similar device at CES 2020, as reported by ,. Meet the Asus Hyper M.2 X16 GEN 4 Card.,The card doesn't appear to be much different in function from Gigabyte's unit, and will likely offer similar performance levels. (More on that in a little bit.) The unit comes in the form of a long, single-slot add-in-card.,The card relies on a sleek brushed aluminum slab that covers its entire casing for cooling. A small blower-style fan inside the slab helps out, too, but it can be disabled for people who need total silence. (Which could be useful in scenarios where people are recording, for example, and don't want to hear a fan in the background.),No details are available yet on the card's exact performance, though that will largely depend on the M.2 SSDs that you install inside the unit. Naturally, to get the best performance out of the unit you'll have to install it in an AMD X570 or TRX40 system, because Intel does not have a solution with PCI-Express 4.0 support yet.,There's no word on when Asus plans to release the card or how much it will cost."
UltraRAM Is 'Universal Memory' That Brings RAM-Like Speed to Non-Volatile Storage ,"Researchers at Lancaster University in the UK have invented a new form of “universal memory” that works as both storage and ,. The technology, called UltraRAM and detailed in a , this month, looks to change how existing computers, smartphones and other devices work.,UltraRAM combines the benefits of flash storage and DRAM into one. While storage technologies, such as hard disk drives (HDD) or solid state drives (,) store data much cheaper than ,per GB of data, they're also significantly slower. RAM, in which data is held as long as it’s being worked on and the disappears if power is lost, is much faster, so the ,can access data here more quickly than it can on HDD or SSD. ,Non-volatile RAM (NVRAM)  promises to combine the two worlds. However, we haven’t seen a memory technology that combines the storage capability with speeds comparable to RAM (there are some candidates, such as ,, but they’ve fallen short on various metrics). ,UlraRAM is NVRAM with 100 times lower switching energy per unit area than DRAM but with similar operating speeds. Its inventors claimed that it combines the advantages of DRAM memory and flash storage with none of the drawbacks, making it ideal to become a universal memory technology.,UltraRAM would likely have one main drawback in the first decade or so of its production -- should it ever reach that point -- and that would be the price per GB. This is a drawback virtually all new technologies, such as NVRAM, have. However, if UltraRAM succeeds in providing improvements over DRAM-based modules, then it could be just a matter of time before the economies of scale allow for pricing that's reasonable for mainstream customers. ,UltraRAM is a compound semiconductor charge-storage memory that exploits the quantum mechanical effect of resonant tunnelling, allowing a barrier to switch from opaque to transparent when a small voltage is applied. This process consumes very little power, while promising operational speeds similar to RAM. ,The non-volatility of UltraRAM results from band offsets of indium arsenide and aluminium antimonide, which provide a large energy barrier (2.1eV) that prevents the electrons from escaping. ,The quick transition from opacity to transparency of the resonant-tunnelling barrier facilitates a highly compact architecture with a high bit density. In other words, we may be able to see the technology implemented in multi-GB chips, as opposed to multi-MB chips, which is pretty much the limit for competing universal memory technologies with RAM-level speed right now."
Seagate Announces Thunderbolt 3 Gaming Dock and New FireCuda SSDs,"Seagate is blazing up a firestorm with the release of two new storage products for gamers, a new gaming dock, and a PCIe 4.0 x4 FireCuda SSD. The company is also refreshing a few of the other SSDs in its lineup, too.,Seagate’s FireCuda Gaming Dock is a high-end gaming hub that integrates a docking station and external storage into one device. It’s meant to be a perfect fit for laptop gamers who aren’t ready to jump on the desktop gaming PC bandwagon yet.,As many laptops are constrained by storage, Seagate is launching the unit with 4TB 7200RPM HDD inside for those growing game libraries. The company also threw in a PCIe 3.0 x4 M.2 expansion slot just in case you’re looking to add some high-speed NVMe storage, too.,The dock features one-cord plug-and-play connectivity over a single Thunderbolt 3 input. There are also 10 connections to the docking station to connect your other peripherals. ,• 1x TB3 port for accessory devices,• 1x DisplayPort 1.4,• 4x USB 3.1 Gen 2 ports,• 1x USB 3.1 Gen 2 battery charge port ,• 1x RJ45 Ethernet network port,• 1x 3.5mm audio-in / mic port,• 1x 3.5mm audio-out port,Unfortunately, there is no charging support for laptops, so you will have to use your power brick when you're connected to the dock. But it offers a slick industrial design with LED illumination. It comes to market with an MSRP of $349.99 and a three-year warranty.,If the gaming dock wasn’t enough to spark your interest, Seagate’s new PCIe 4.0 x4 M.2 NVMe SSD just might. It’s Seagate's top-of-the-line SSD, and a solid choice to add some more speed to your new AMD Ryzen 3000 build.,Like a few other PCIe 4.0 SSDs in the market, Seagate’s FireCuda 520 features a Phison E16 SSD controller that has been validated by the company. Paired with Kioxia’s 96L BiCS4 TLC NAND flash, Seagate says this combo enables incredible performance with up to 5,000/4,400 MBps of sequential read/write throughput and up to 760,000/700,000 random read/write IOPS. ,The drive comes with a black PCB and has an MTBF rating of 1.8M hours. It also comes with a five-year warranty with endurance figures of up to 3,600 TB to match. Available now, Seagate’s FireCuda 520 comes in three capacities: 500GB, 1TB, and 2TB. ,MSRPs are $124.99 (500GB), $249.99 (1TB), and $429.99 (2TB).,While the FireCuda 520 launch steals the spotlight, Seagate’s FireCuda 510 PCIe 3.0 x4 M.2 NVMe SSD gets some love, too. Today, Seagate told us that it is refreshing the FireCuda 510 with new hardware. ,First, Seagate added in a black PCB to appeal for those concerned about aesthetics. Who likes ugly blue and green PCBs distracting from your blacked-out or red accented gaming build, anyways? ,Seagate also swapped out the NAND from 64L BiCS3 to the latest Kioxia 96L BiCS4 flash. They have also added in a 500GB capacity point because high-capacity models are a hot seller.,Just as the FireCuda is expanding to smaller capacities, the company’s mainstream PCIe 3.0 x4 M.2 NVMe SSD, the BarraCuda 510, is getting a 1TB model. Like the FireCuda, the BarraCuda features a Seagate-validated Phison E12 SSD controller and the latest Kioxia 96L BiCS4 flash, but not the fancy black PCB.,The main difference between the BarraCuda 510 and FireCuda 510, other than aesthetics and capacity points, is that the BarraCuda is a single-sided M.2 SSD optimized for flexible compatibility, while FireCuda is a double-sided M.2 solution optimized for enhanced performance and greater endurance.,To conclude the refresh list, we finally have the BarraCuda 120 SSD. Seagate’s BarraCuda 120 is a 2.5 in × 7mm SATA 6Gb/s SSD that replaces the previous BarraCuda SSD. ,Seagate replaced the internals with new and up-to-date hardware. The company also swapped out the aging S10 SSD controller and replaced it with a Phison S12 SATA controller to ready it for 3D NAND. Seagate will have two sources of NAND for this SSD. Depending on inventory, the BarraCuda 120 will come with either Kioxia 96L BiCS4 TLC or Micron 64L TLC to ensure consistent supply. "
"Fujifilm Won't Let Tape Storage Die: New LTO-8 Cartridges with 12TB/30TB capacity, 750 MBps Transfer Rate","One of the first things readers may be wondering when clicking on this article may be, tape backups are still viable in 2019? And that answer is a resounding ""yes,"" in particular with large enterprises (not for home/consumers). To that end, Fujifilm has announced the general availability of the LTO-8 (Linear Tape-Open) data cartridge. The new cartridge can support 12TB native and 30TB compressed at a 2.5:1 ratio (compression ratios will vary by the data and other factors). The capacity doubles the previous generation LTO-7 volumes which the company says addresses the increasing need for high capacity, cost-effective and reliable long term storage.,While LTO-8 tapes are not new (LTO Ultrium 8 was released in 2017) it is good to see Fuji back in the game. The only two producers, Sony and Fuji, were tied up in a patent infringement lawsuit which stopped Sony from importing them to the US and Fuji, as late as June of 2019, saying they were not currently manufacturing LTO 8 and not selling them to that point. This created a shortage, but only effected those organizations which tend to quickly move to the higher capacity storage media. In the end, a higher-capacity tape allows customers to store more data and better utilize the existing footprint of the tape library. With real estate in Data Centers at an extreme premium, it can make sense to move to a higher capacity tape. ,History out of the way, the new LTO Ultrium 8 (Ultrium is the form factor) data cartridge is based on Fujifilm's nanocubic thin coating technology incorporating finer barium ferrite (BaFe) particles than in previous generations. The magnetic material features a high signal-to-noise ratio said to result in higher stability and the ability to store data for more than 50 years. Transfer speeds increased from 700 MB/s on LTO-7 up to 750 MB/s in LTO-8 for compressed data, and 360 MB/s (up from 300 MB/s) for uncompressed data. ,So what is the point? With more information being created in these large organizations, the need to back up more data then to be able to retrieve and use it is paramount for many of today's enterprise size and smaller companies. While there are direct-to-tape and hybrid (FLAPE) solutions available, the initial capital expenditure may be too much for a company to handle without significant lead time for planning and budgets. Additionally, the time, effort and cost to migrate data will also play a role. ,Fujifilm's LTO Ultrium 8 tapes are available now. "
Biostar Announces New S120 Series SATA SSDs,"Biostar, which is better known for its motherboards, has just expanded its storage portfolio with the new family of S120 SATA SSDs.,The Biostar S120 has everything you would expect from your everyday 2.5-inch SATA SSD. The drive is housed inside a black enclosure that has a thickness of 7mm. The SSD communicates with your system through a SATA III interface. It's compatible with Windows, Linux, and Mac operating systems.,According to Biostar, S120 SSD has a six-layer PCB and can withstand environmental temperatures up to 70°C. However, the manufacturer doesn't mention the model of the SSD controller or what kind of NAND chips it used to fabricate the S120.,Biostar offers the S120 SSDs in capacities of 128GB, 256GB, 512GB and 1TB. The S120 SSDs are rated with sequential read speeds of 550 MBps. The 1TB and 512GB models boast sequential write speeds of 525 MBps, while the 256GB and 128GB models are limited to 520 MBps. Sadly, Biostar didn't specify the drive's random performance or warranty period.,There is no official word when the Biostar S120 SSDs will make their way to market or how much they will cost."

The drive is based on the, and NVMe standards with read and write speeds listed up to 3500/3000 MBps and 300K/240K IOPS, respectively. The drive uses 3D NAND flash, SLC caching and a DRAM cache buffer to help reach those speeds. The SX8100 comes in a 2280 size form factor, up to a 2TB capacity and supports the latest Intel and AMD platforms.,The 3D NAND includes data protection and correction technologies said to increase TBW (total bytes written). This includes LDPC (low-density parity-check) error correcting code technology, which today's announcement said detects and fixes a wider range of data errors. There is also E2E (End-to-End) data protection and RAID Engine to help ensure security, integrity and durability of the device.,To that end, the SX8100 is backed by a 5-year warranty with a 2,000,000 hour MTBF rating. In TBW, that yields to 320/640/1280 TBW for the 512GB, 1TB and 2TB ,, respectively. Most users will be hard-pressed to eclipse those values in normal use scenarios.,In the past, Adata has used mostly SMI controllers, and while one wasn't mentioned in Adata's announcement, there is speculation they used a Realtek controller for this unit. Also not listed is the amount of DRAM on board (we suspect it is less than, slower, or both compared to the SX8200). We've reached out to Adata to get get some clarity and will update the article if we hear back.,Neither pricing nor availability were listed, but we expect to see these soon. "
Where's MAMR? WD Announces 18TB & 20TB HDDs,"Western Digital , two new high-capacity enterprise drives, the Ultrastar DC HC550 CMR HDD and the Ultrastar DC HC650 SMR HDD, on Tuesday. Numerous reports  claimed these drives are the first to feature WD's Microwave Assisted Magnetic Recording (MAMR) technology, but a spokesperson told us they ""can not disclose specific details about which energy assist technologies are used in each drive."",WD said the drives are part of its Capacity Enterprise HDDs portfolio that ranges from a six-disk 10TB drive with an air-based HDD to a nine-disk 20TB drive with a helium-based HDD. The Ultrastar DC HC550 CMR HDD will be available in 16TB and 18TB capacities, and the Ultrastar DC HC650 SMR HDD will be available in a 20TB capacity, sometime in the first half of 2020. (WD is sampling the drives now.),The use of Shingled Magnetic Recording (SMR) in the 20TB drive suggested that WD was finally read to introduce a MAMR drive. The company , in October 2017 to push HDD capacities up to 40TB. Seagate , Heat Assisted Magnetic Recording (HAMR) technology a month later, saying its tiny lasers would scale better than WD's magnetic helpers.,We noticed that WD didn't mention MAMR in the announcement for these new drivers, however, or in the white papers it published. So we reached out to the company and were told ""The 18TB Ultrastar DC HC550 is the first HDD in the industry using energy-assisted recording technology. As part of our MAMR development, we’ve discovered a variety of energy-assisted techniques that boost areal density."",MAMR and HAMR are the only two energy-assisted recording technologies headed to mass production that we know of. This could imply that WD is playing coy about the debut of MAMR in one of these drives; using MAMR or HAMR in different HDDs included in the lineup, or using a new recording technology it hasn't yet announced. Hopefully we learn more about what exactly is happening with WD's work on next-gen recording tech sooner than later.,More details about the , and the , can be found on their respective product pages."
Samsung Develops Industry’s First Standards-Based ‘Key Value’ SSD Prototype,"Samsung announced it had developed the industry’s first prototype “Key Value” (KV) SSD that is compliant with the corresponding new open standard. KV SSDs move today’s storage workload of CPUs into the SSD, leading to much-improved software and hardware efficiency. This paves the way for a new generation of high-performance and scalable storage architectures.,For some background, data is stored in SSDs in fixed-sized blocks (the smallest erasable amount of data in an SSD), each with its own ID. But most real-world data is unstructured, like music, photo and zip files. So SSDs normally convert object data (which can widely vary in size) into data fragments with the size of these blocks. When some data is changed, the whole block is erased and reprogrammed.,To cater to real-world usage models, most real-world data center software (e.g. LevelDB, Amazon DynamoDB) uses key value storage where a variable-sized key refers to a variable-sized collection of data. In programming this is called a key-value tuple. In other words, a key is submitted followed by either putting or receiving the data associated with the key.,However, key value software places quite some burden on the host processor as it uses valuable CPU resources. The industry’s concern was that as the speed of SSDs continued to increase, system-level performance would be saturated as it got bottlenecked by CPU overhead due to the burden of managing blocks and operations. So the idea behind a Key Value SSD, then, is to support key value storage (KVS) natively: each key enables direct addressing of a data location. This eliminates processes such as logical and physical block addressing. Instead of a block device driver, a KV SSD has a KV device driver and it is accessed through a KV library. Through this software and hardware co-design, resources can be moved from the host CPU to the SSD.,While Samsung already made a proprietary KV SSD prototype , (and submitted its proposal for a standard), in April this year the Storage Networking Industry Association (SNIA) released the new open standard , that serves to provide a vendor-independent Key Value Storage (KVS) programming interface. Samsung , that it has developed the first SSD prototype that is compliant with the open standard, but did not provide further specifications.,Michael Oros, SNIA Executive Director, sees Key Value SSDs becoming widely used: “The SNIA KV API specification, which provides an industry-wide interface between an application and a Key Value SSD, paves the way for widespread industry adoption of a standardized KV API protocol.”,Samsung claims numerous benefits associated with KV storage technology. Moving storage operations to the SSD itself – in a standardized manner – frees the host CPU from computational work such as block operations and storage-level garbage collection (which is needed with software-based KVS), resulting in greater system-level performance and higher software efficiency. The reduced CPU overhead also provides substantially improved scalability in the number of interlinked SSDs. Write amplification is also said to be much reduced. (, is a phenomenon whereby more data is written than intended, due to the much larger size of blocks that can be erased compared to the smaller pages that can be written.) Lastly, each SSD experiences less wear, prolonging its lifetime.,In a 2017 presentation, Samsung showed that its KV prototype handled 8x more queries per second (QPS) in a random put benchmark and reduced traffic to device by over 90%. Furthermore, as the number of SSDs increased to 18, the amount of queries per second increased practically linearly, resulting in 15x higher QPS than a standard block SSD. Similar results were achieved with a sequential benchmark and with a scale-out test to multiple clients. In terms of CPU utilization, the regular SSD achieved up to 400k QPS at 80% utilization, compared to the KV implementation that yielded 2.1M QPS at 30% utilization.,Samsung said it is working with several companies to build an ecosystem for the technology. Its KV SSD prototype is also “sufficiently advanced” that it is making it available to companies for application development. Samsung did not say when it expects to commercialize this new technology. , that this won't happen until a key-value extension for NVMe is finalized."

"Intel Announces Optane DIMMs for Workstations, SSD 665P With 96-Layer QLC, Roadmap","Intel made a slew of announcements today, including workstation support for Optane DC Persistent Memory DIMMs, which will eventually lead to support on the mainstream client desktops, like gaming PCs. These DIMMs slot into the DDR4 interface, just like a stick of RAM, but use Optane memory instead of DRAM to offer up to 512GB of memory capacity per stick.,Intel also announced new SSD 665p manufactured with 96-Layer QLC flash and revealed a roadmap outlining its future Optane SSD products and new 144-Layer QLC NAND. The company also announced that it is working towards developing 5-bit-per-cell flash, otherwise known as penta-level cell (PLC), to offer a path to increased storage density and lower-priced storage. ,Intel's Optane DC Persistent Memory DIMMs come in three capacities of 128, 256, and 512GB. That's a massive capacity increase compared to current DDR4 memory sticks and can be used as either memory or storage, retaining data even when power is removed. Intel designed the DIMMs to bridge both the performance and pricing gap between storage and memory, with the underlying 3D XPoint memory being fast enough to serve as a slower tier of DRAM, though it does require some tuning of the application and driver stacks.,Using Optane memory instead of DRAM promises radical new capabilities and much lower pricing, but the technology has been confined to use in servers, like the ,. Now Intel is bringing Persistent DIMMs to the workstation market, and then the desktop. Intel hasn't announced a firm arrival date for workstations with the new technology but says that it enables up to 3TB of memory for a single-socket workstation, while dual-socket workstations will have up to 6TB of memory capacity. We have seen numerous server designs that use watercooling for Optane DIMMs, as they require copious amounts of airflow to avoid throttling, so we can expect new workstations to require active cooling for the DIMMS due to much lower airflow rates in the chassis than servers.,Intel's DIMMs are working their way down from the data center to workstations, and the company plans to bring them down a step further into mainstream desktop platforms. That means you'll soon be able to buy a 512GB memory stick for your desktop rig, but while Intel is working with Microsoft to enable the capability through the current ecosystem development initiatives, there is no strict timeline for Optane DIMMs to land on the desktop.,Intel's will follow its first-gen Apache Pass DIMMs with second-gen Barlow Pass modules that will arrive with the 14nm Cooper Lake and 10nm Ice Lake data center processors in 2020. We can also expect those same modules to work with future workstations.,Intel's ""Cold Stream"" Optane DC P4800X SSDs, which use the same Optane media but serve as fast storage devices, have been shipping in volume for some time. However, the company is already moving forward with its next-gen Alder Stream SSDs, which it has running in its labs. Intel hasn't provided firm specifications for the new SSDs, but touts improved throughput, likely through the move to a PCIe Gen 4 interface, as a key advance. As we've seen with the existing data center models, we can expect those SSD controller improvements to filter down to the client SSD products when Intel refreshes its Optane 900p and 905p.,Intel's SSD 660p uses 64-Layer QLC flash, which stores four bits per cell, to provide increased storage density and lower pricing, albeit at the loss of some performance. The firm plans to release a new SSD 665p with 96-Layer QLC flash, which will expand upon the inherent price advantages of denser media. Intel didn't divulge pricing, performance, or a release date, but it's logical to expect to hear more about these SSDs around the CES timeframe.,Intel is also working on 144-layer QLC flash, and like its soon-to-be ex-manufacturing partner Micron, the company is also developing penta-level flash that stores five bits-per-cell.,Intel is also moving forward on the Optane media front, with a new design center opening in Rio Rancho, New Mexico. Intel didn't mention any specific focus areas of the center, but we can expect this to include the next-gen 3D XPoint media. Intel has numerous paths forward to improve the media, such as higher stacking and/or a smaller lithography among the most obvious areas of development. The company is currently largely bound by the performance of its SSD controllers, meaning they don't allow end devices to extract the full performance of the underlying 3D XPoint memory, so its rational to expect more advances on the SSD controller front before we see the next-gen Optane media arrive."
Step Into The SSD World With Intel's 1TB SSD 660p For $85,"Every computer deserves an SSD, and yours do too. If you have an empty M.2 slot, the Intel SSD 660p 1TB can be your new tenant. The SSD normally retails for over $100, but Newegg has it for $84.99 after applying the EMCTEVC22 promotional code at checkout.,The Intel SSD 660p is an M.2 2280 SSD that will provide you with 1TB of high-speed storage. The SSD communicates with your system through a conventional PCIe 3.0 x4 M.2 slot, which is pretty common on modern motherboards. Whether you need a primary storage device or just a backup drive, the Intel SSD 660p is a nice option.,The Intel SSD 660p unites Silicon Motion's SM2263 NVMe SSD controller with Intel's 64-layer 3D QLC (quad-level cell) NAND chips. This unique combination delivers sequential read and write speeds up to 1,800 MB/s.

With excellent overclocking capability and perfect compatibility, this DDR4 memory can provide extremely superior performance on the new generation platform of AMD.”"
One Year Later: Intel Adds Heatsink To M.2 Optane 905P SSD,"According to a recent product notice,Intel has added a , to its Optane SSD 905P SSDs. The company , a year ago, but a handful of concerns were raised about its ability to dissipate heat. This was only a natural response from the market because the other forms of Intel Optane 905P SSDs, such as the U.2-connected model and the more-common , add-in-card, all had metal heatsinks. Yet the M.2 model lacked this particular feature when it came out roughly one year ago.,At the time, third-party cooler-maker , that you could add on to the SSD to handle cooling. This was great, except that it cost an additional $20 plus shipping – and a lot of people weren’t amused by the apparent necessity for a third-party cooler, or the hassle of the extra effort. Consequently, we doubt many buyers opted to take this route.,It appears that Intel has listened to those concerns. It might have taken almost a year, but the chipmaker has come out with its own cooling solution for the 380GB Optane 905P ,. It consists of an Optane-branded metal plate for each side of the unit.,The cooling solution will be shipped with all new units of the Intel Optane 905P M.2 SSD, although some current inventory might still ship without it. As noted by ,, if you already own one of these SSDs, you can request a free heatsink at"
Silicon Power P34A60 NVMe SSDs Can Pack Up to 2TB,"Silicon Power, a Taiwanese manufacturer, , The P34A60. Unlike a solid handful of recent SSDs we’ve seen come out, this one only works on the ‘older’ PCI-Express 3.0 bus instead of the newer 4.0 specification, but it does utilize all four lanes the M.2 slot has access to.,The unit supports NVMe 1.3, and will read at up to 2200 MB/s and write at up to 1600 MB/s. The unit also comes with ECC features and low-density parity check functionality.,Being an M.2 SSD based on the 80mm long specification, next to fitting in almost all modern desktops, it will also fit in quite a few modern laptops.,Capacities available include 256GB, 512GB, 1TB, and 2TB. The units also support RAID functionality, so pairing them up for increased performance or increased redundancy is certainly an option.,At the time of writing, pricing has not yet been announced. Given that this unit does not run on the new PCI-Express 4.0 standard, we wouldn’t expect it to be all too pricey."
Flash Memory Wear Killing Older Tesla's Due to Excessive Data Logging: Report,"With electric vehicles now on the market in masses and coming of age, we’re starting to see the real culprits of aging. For internal combustion engines, the types of components that age are quite well known, but we’ve always assumed that electric cars would have much longer lifespans due to the simplicity of their moving parts – or rather, the lack of moving parts. Now, ,, it appears that certain electronics inside older Tesla’s are causing problems for owners.,The culprit resides in the flash memory in the media control unit in older Tesla vehicles based on the MCUv1. As any modern-day vehicle does, Tesla’s log data, but it appears the vehicles log ‘excessive’ amounts of data, and although this gets overwritten in the memory all the time, it does cause wear to the underlying flash. The Tesla firmware wasn't very big at the beginning, so the logged data had lots of spare room to play with, thus allowing the write workload to spread out over a large amount of memory. As new Tesla features have rolled out, though, the firmware has grown, leaving very little room for the logging to take place. That means individual sectors suffer from lots of data being written in a short amount of time, further accelerating the wear., ,Flash memory is used in many devices, including the likes of SD cards, SSDs, USB sticks, your phone, and many more kinds of devices, including cars. Flash memory, just like hard drives (and any electronic device, for that matter), has a finite lifespan, and once a block has been written over a certain number of times it eventually is no longer reliable and gets marked as a bad sector. At the start of flash memory’s life, when there are not yet any bad sectors, the memory will maintain its total capacity for quite a long time. However, as these bad sectors start building up, they can eventually impact the total memory capacity. Typically, this is never a problem throughout the useful lifespan of most electronic devices – except with Tesla vehicles, which apparently log excessive amounts of data that leads to premature wear of the memory chips.,A few months ago, when this problem first hit the news, Tesla did not appear to have a fix. Communities created do-it-yourself user guides on how to fix the problem, but Tesla doesn't take well to people working on their own cars, and for many people, dismantling the media control unit and replacing the eMMC storage isn’t an option when they depend on their car.,Today, it looks like Tesla will fix the problem if you're within the warranty, and outside-of-warranty repairs can cost $1,800 to $3,000, depending on your location. Tesla’s method is to replace the entire MCU. ,Fortunately, Jason Hughes, known as a ‘Tesla hacker,’ can service these units at a much lower cost. His method is to replace the eMMC on the MCU using specialized equipment, and copy over the unique vehicle identifiers and keys so that users can still access Tesla’s updates and services. If you get to him early enough before the eMMC wears out, he can also change the coding of the vehicle to write the logs to the RAM instead of the flash memory to prevent the wear. This solution comes at the cost of a small performance penalty, though.,Newer memory in newer Tesla models is more resistant to the wear of repeated rewriting, but there is a catch. Hughes also explained that although this problem currently only impacts older vehicles, it is likely to begin plaguing newer models, too. “Instead of mitigating the issue, it writes even more data to the logs today than ever before. Combined with the max-size firmware images, general caching – map tiles, Autopilot info, music, etc. – this makes every MCUv1 have a high probability of failure,” Hughes told InsideEVs. He further elaborated “MCUv2 and Model 3 also have an issue with excessive logging. Fortunately, they have a larger flash memory size, which should mitigate the issue for the time being. Tesla will still have to eliminate or curb this logging significantly on these if they want them to last, though.”,In short, the newer Tesla’s are still too early in their lifetime to start suffering from memory problems, but unless Tesla does something about the excessive logging behavior, it’s only a matter of when these units will fail. Nevertheless, Elon Musk has commented on the matter in a tweet responding to Hughes, stating it “Should be much better at this point.” ,We’re not sure what to make of that as a statement."
Micron Expands Enterprise SSD Lineup To 7300 & 5300 Series,"Micron is announcing two new series of SSD’s: the 5300 series and the 7300. Both of these series are aimed at data center use, and both are built on Micron’s new 96-layer NAND. Where the 7300 series is optimized for high-performance and high throughput workloads, the 5300 series is aimed towards more read-oriented workloads that require high reliability.,As mentioned, the , are meant for high-throughput, and are therefore built on NVMe, sporting four PCI-Express 3.0 lanes for access, and they will receive a dual-port NVMe support update in the near future.,The 7300 series will come in four different flavors: U.2 drives and M.2 drives, each coming in PRO and MAX versions. The Pro versions are more oriented towards read-intensive tasks, handling wear and tear of up to one drive write per day, with the MAX series able to handle up to three drive writes per day in endurance. Mean time between failure for these units is rated at two million hours.,Despite slowly reducing in the consumer market, Micron is still pushing SATA SSDs hard in the enterprise space, where it claims that lots of system upgrades can be accomplished on infrastructure still running on SATA. , also feature the 96-layer NAND, and because they’re more built for mass storage and reliability of data, they are rated to a mean time between failure of three million hours.,The 5300 series will exist in a handful of different flavors too. There is a “Boot” series intended for the OS installation which will only come in an M.2 format, and a PRO line that will come in M.2 and 2.5” formats, although the 3.84 TB and 7.68 TB variants of these will only come in a 2.5” format. There is also the 5300 MAX series, which come only in the 2.5” format, but feature significantly higher write endurance than their PRO counterparts., "
Micron Finally Rolls 3D XPoint SSD: X100 Billed as 'World's Fastest' with 2.5 Million IOPS and 9 GBps,"Micron announced its X100 SSD today, which its bills as the world's fastest SSD with 9GB/s of sequential performance in both read, write, and mixed workloads, and up to 2.5 million random IOPS. ,Micron touts the new PCIE 3.0 x16 device as delivering an impressive 8 microseconds of latency, which is faster than Intel's claimed 10 microseconds of latency from its Optane SSDs. The SSD is also notably faster at sequential and random performance than any of Intel's competing Optane devices.,, which blends ""DRAM-like"" performance with a much lower price point and persistence (data remains on the storage device after power is removed). After the initial announcement in 2015, Intel went on to develop a wide range of 3D XPoint-powered devices, branded Optane, that encompass both , and ,. ,Micron initially announced QuantX, , that promised to upend the enterprise storage market, in 2016, but those drives never made it to market. In the interim, , on joint 3D XPoint development, leaving Micron with no vehicle to sell it own 3D XPoint-infused devices on the open market. ,That changes today with the debut of ,. Here are the product highlights:,The back of the card reveals 16 emplacements for 3D XPoint packages, but it isn't clear if the SSD uses the first generation of the memory, or the soon-to-arrive second generation. ,We also see the X100 has an auxiliary 8-pin power connector, which means this drive will consume quite a bit of power. The cooling solution is passive and designed to take advantage of the linear airflow in servers. Micron isn't sharing specifics of its controller, though we are told it is a proprietary design. ,Unfortunately, Micron's X100 series is aimed at the data center for now, meaning we won't see an equivalent for the desktop market in the near term. However, with Micron now finally making headway on its own 3D XPoint-infused SSDs, we hope that will change in the future. Micron says it is sampling the drives to early customers now, but hasn't shared information about the various capacity points or pricing. "
Microsoft’s New Surfaces Use Toshiba’s Tiny BG4 SSD,"As soon as we learned from , last week that at least one of Microsoft’s new Surface devices sports a super-tiny 2230 SSD (that’s just 30mm or 1.2 inches long), we suspected that the drive in question came from Toshiba. Why? Because Toshiba (which is ,), is the only company we knew of that currently makes drives that small.,In fact, we recently reviewed the company’s , a 2230 M.2 SSD that fits Microsoft’s description exactly, and was designed to be an OEM solution for devices like the Surface. The 1TB unit we tested had strong performance for its size, offering up to 4 times the speed of a SATA drive, but high-end M.2 NVMe drives like the Samsung 970 PRO had transfer rates that were up to 1,000 MBps quicker.,Now, after checking out display units of some of Microsoft’s latest devices at a local Best Buy, we can confirm that the 13-inch version of the Surface Laptop 3 indeed uses the Toshiba BG4 drive (specifically KGB40ZNS128G in the unit we looked at), but not exclusively.,Interestingly, the , that we saw at the same Best Buy uses an SK Hynix drive (HFM256GDGTNG-97A0A), which doesn’t appear to have been officially announced. But based on a similar model that ,, the SK Hynix drive in the 15-inch Surface Laptop 3 is also an NVMe 2230 drive.,Furthering the complications, we checked out a few more new Surface models at a nearby Microsoft store. And a 13-inch Surface Laptop 3 that I looked at did not have a Toshiba drive in it, but the same SK Hynix SSD model as the 15-inch Surface Laptop we spotted at Best Buy.,To round out the new Surface devices that you can currently find in a store, we also checked out what SSD’s inside the , at a Microsoft Store. The Pro 7 also sports a version of Toshiba/Kioxia’s BG4 SSD (KBG40ZPZ256G), but the previous-generation Surface Pro 6 had a soldered-down SSD, so it’s unlikely you’ll be upgrading the Surface Pro 7’s storage.,The Surface Pro X we saw in the Microsoft store had a drive with the model name HFB1M8MO331C0MR, which doesn’t show up in search results at all. It’s not even clear who the manufacturer is. But given that device isn’t slated to launch until next month, and Microsoft had the tablet encased in a big hunk of plastic so that all you could see was the screen, there’s a good chance it wasn’t a final unit, and may contain a different drive than what we saw in the store.,What does all this tell us? Well, it seems that you can expect either a Toshiba or an SK Hynix drive on most of the new single-display Surface devices (save for the Pro X, which is still up in the air). But it’s unclear whether Microsoft is sourcing multiple drives for the same laptops (we saw both a Toshiba and an SK Hynix drive in different models of the 13-inch Surface Laptop 3 in different stores), or if the display units we saw weren’t representative of the final shipping products.,Whether the drives are made by SK Hynix or or Toshiba, it doesn’t look like end users will be able to find replacement models on the aftermarket any time soon. That matters because Microsoft is charging a ridiculous $300 to move up from a 128GB to a 256GB model so, if you can do your own upgrade, there’s plenty of incentive to do so. Of course, Microsoft doesn't advise doing so and recommends using its technicians. And trying could void your warranty.,Perhaps, after launch, another vendor will step in to fill this void in the market and sell M.2 2230 SSDs. Given that Microsoft’s Surface devices are some of the highest-profile products in the PC industry, we wouldn’t be surprised to see multiple tiny 2230 M.2 drives pop up in the coming months."
"Aorus’ New PCIe 4 SSD Gobbles Up 16 Lanes of PCIe, Might Make Your GPU Jealous","Even though it’s not really a secret anymore, Gigabyte now , this week the Aorus Gen4 AIC SSD 8TB. This is a , add-in-card which houses four 2TB , x4 NVMe ,, which turns it into, for lack of better words, an absolute storage monster.,Add those numbers up, and you’ve got an 8TB NVMe SSD that runs over the new PCIe 4.0 standard with access to 16 lanes. Gigabyte claims that it should manage a throughput (read and write) of about 15,000 MBps. The unit is rated at 430,000 random read IOPS and 440,000 random write IOPS.,Let’s just put this into perspective. The typical 2.5-inch SATA SSD has a throughput of around 550 MBps, and if you’ve got a fancy PCIe 3.0 x4 NVMe M.2 SSD, you might have a read speed of about 3,500 MBps. This makes Gigabyte’s new AIC almost 30 times as fast as the SATA SSDs many users have.,Gigabyte’s new AIC SSD does need some cooling, though. It comes with a blower-style cooler that pulls air in and exhausts it out the back of the card, outside the ,. On its way, it cools a copper ,placed over the quadruplet of , installed inside the unit. Inside Gigabyte also fitted the unit with eight temperature sensors, which can be monitored from within the Aorus Storage Manager software. Interestingly, this SSD is one of the few Aorus-branded products that doesn’t come with RGB lighting (though we doubt that's a primary concern of anyone looking at this offering). ,The M.2 SSDs inside the unit are built with Toshiba BiSC4 96-layer 3D TLC NAND, which enable a transfer rate of up to 800 MTps. The NAND on each SSD is brought together by a Phison PS5016-E16 controller. Durability is rated at 3,600 TBW per 2TB SSD. Because we expect this to be a rather costly purchase that any user would want to last, it's fortunate Gigabyte offers a 5-year warranty with it.,This all sounds good, but is there is a caveat. As noted, the Aorus Gen4 AIC SSD 8TB runs on PCIe 4.0. So the only platform you can currently use this with is an an AMD X570 ,paired with an AMD Ryzen 3000 CPU. The Ryzen 3000 CPUs have 24 PCIe lanes – four of which are downstream to the ,. Consequently, from the 20 lanes left, you’d eat up 16 with the Aorus SSD. That leaves only 4 lanes, which may be enough for a , (given that PCIe 4.0 is effectively twice as fast as PCIe 3.0), but the PCIe 4.0 interface is so new it's hard to know for sure without testing. ,Thankfully, the rumor mill has been working hard and the TRX40 platform for , is set to launch next month. Given that the CPUs will carry similar specs as AMD’s Epyc line of CPUs, which have 128 PCIe 4.0 lanes, we’re confident that the Ryzen 3000 Threadripper will have a sufficient number of lanes for utilizing Gigabyte's new Aorus Gen4 AIC SSD 8TB.,No pricing has been revealed yet."
"WD Launches New Red SSDs for NAS, 14TB Red HDDs","WD launched updates to the company’s NAS (network attached storage) portfolio. These include two new 14TB Red and Red Pro HDDs along with an all-new Red SA500 SSD.,Due to growing speed demands and the increased availability in 10GbE connectivity, WD saw a need to provide both home users and small businesses with some flash for their NAS devices. WD’s new Red SA500 is a SATA based SSD that is targeted to compete against Seagate’s IronWolf 110 NAS SSD. It is stated to be a great option for caching and with high endurance, it can handle heavy read and write workloads 24/7.,It comes in both 2.5” 7mm and M.2 2280 form factors and capacities range from 500GB up to 4TB (2.5” only). Price-wise, these SSDs come with MSRPs of $72 at 500GB up to $600 for the largest capacity. They are currently available in limited quantities at the WD store, but will be widely available in November.,In addition to the new SSD, the company is expanding the Red and Red Pro HDDs up to 14TB. Like the SA500, they will be widely available in November and are rated for 24/7 operation.,The 14TB WD Red, part number WD140EFFX, is designed to be used in NAS with up to 8 bays, making it ideal for small and home office environments. It operates at 5,400rpm and is rated to handle a workload rate of up to 180TB a year. Like the other WD Reds, the 14TB model comes with a three-year warranty. It releases with an MSRP of $450.,WD’s 14TB Red Pro, part number WD141KFGX, is a bit faster than the normal Red, 7200 RPM rather than 5400 RPM. It is ideal for big businesses and is supported to be used in NASes with up to 24-bays. It features 3D Active Balance Plus technology, and error recovery controls with NASware 3.0 technology for enhanced reliability. MSRP for this model is $525 and comes with a five-year warranty."
Crucial Expands BX500 SSD to 2TB,"The , SSD, which previously topped out at 1TB, is now available in the 2TB capacity. ,Similar to the 1TB model, the BX500 2TB SSD continues to use a combination of Silicon Motion's SM2259XT DRAM-less SSD controller and Micron's 96-layer 3D TLC (triple-level cell) NAND flash memory. The ,comes in a 2.5-inch format that measures 7mm thick and communicates with your system through a standard SATA III connector.,The performance for the BX500 2TB SSD remains untouched as well. Crucial claims you'll still get maximum sequential read and write speeds up to 540 MBps and 500 MBps, respectively. However, the 2TB model does come with higher endurance. Crucial rates this model with a 720 TBW (terabytes written), which is twice the endurance of the 1TB model. As usual, the SSD comes with a limited three-year warranty.,The Crucial BX500 2TB has a $214.99 price tag, and it's currently available at , and ,. "
Chinese SSD Manufacturer Races Forward to PCIe 5.0,"According to a report by Chinese media ,, Jiangsu Huacun Electronic Technology has demoed its PCIe 5.0 controller at the 2019 Nantong New Generation Information Technology Expo. The memory and storage manufacturer is optimistic that the controller will be in mass-production by the end of 2020.,It was only this year that computer hardware started to arrive with support for the , standard. Presently, PCIe 4.0 is still limited to AMD's current , desktop ,, , HEDT (high-end desktop) CPU line and , server processor portfolio. Intel has yet to board the PCIe 4.0 train, but , soon.,Little is known about the HC9001 PCIe 5.0 controller. It's reportedly produced with the 12nm manufacturing process by the China National Research Institute and Jiangsu Huacun Electronic Technology. The HC9001, which is China's first domestic PCIe 5.0 controller, is gaining a lot of buzz, so perhaps we'll get more information as time progresses.,The PCIe 5.0 standard promises to deliver a throughput up to 128 GBps over a x16 slot. This is double the bandwidth of what the ,4.0 interface can do. At this point, PCIe 5.0 would be overkill for the average consumer, considering that today's mainstream , and , aren't fast enough to use PCIe 4.0 to its max potential. However, PCIe 5.0 will certainly be a welcomed progression in the cloud computing, big data, AI and 5G industries.,An , shows the chipmaker adopting the PCIe 5.0 standard with its forthcoming Sapphire Rapids enterprise-grade processors in 2021. So far, we haven't heard anything about PCIe 5.0 on the AMD front."
Adata's High Performance XPG Spectrix S40G RGB SSD Might Beat Samsung's Best,"Adata today announced the launch of its XPG Spectrix S40G RGB gaming SSD. The new drive has speed ratings that are smoking fast, with the higher-capacity drives reaching speeds of 3,500 MBps reads and 3,000 MBps writes, actually surpassing the rated write throughput of the formidable Samsung Pro line. Aside from its speeds, the S40G includes customizable RGB lighting on the heat spreader, giving the device some aggressive gamer styling. Adata markets the drive to PC enthusiasts, overclockers, and graphics professionals. ,On the performance front, the S40G uses the PCIe 3.0 x4 interface along with SLC caching and internal DRAM buffer, allowing the module to reach some of the highest rated speeds we have seen on a single drive (reads are limited by the PCIe 3.0 x4 bandwidth). The S40G line can reach up to 300K/240K IOPS (4K random reads), which is also quite fast on paper. Adata didn’t mention the controller used to reach these speeds, but we imagine it is the Silicon Motion SM2262EN found in their other high-performance drives. We've reached out to confirm and will update the article as needed.,Capacities on the 2280 size modules will come in 256GB, 512GB, 1TB, and 2TB according to their specifications page (the data sheet does not have any details on the 2TB capacity). Detailed specifications can be found in the table below.,Aside from the lights, the S40G includes a brushed-aluminum heat spreader with the XPG naming in red on the interface side. Flanking the heat spreader on the top and bottom are programmable RGB LEDs hidden under a frosted diffuser, which gives the drive a nice RGB glow. Users are able to customize the lighting patterns, intensity, speed and more through XPG’s RGB control software. There is no mention of the drive working with motherboard RGB ecosystems, however. ,Additional features include LDPC (Low-Density Parity Check) error correcting code technology said to detect and fix a wider range of data errors for more accurate transfers and increased lifespan. There is also E2E (End-to-End) data protection, AES 256-bit encryption, and RAID Engine support for data security and integrity purposes. Adata stands behind these drives with a long 5-year warranty and 2 million hour MTBF (Mean Time Before Failure).,Pricing or availability were mentioned, but we expect these fast drives to fetch a premium due to its speeds and included RGB LED heatsink.  "
Intel’s 2TB 660p NVMe SSD Drops to $175 on Newegg,"Granted, not everyone has the ,. But if you’re looking for a speedy, roomy M.2 drive to boot your system off of, or stash your media library for quick access, Intel’s 660p has been one of the most-affordable (and fast) options for several months now. And today, you can grab the highest-capacity 2TB model for just $175 on Newegg (which is the lowest price we’ve seen apart from some brief blips from third-party sellers). You’ll need to use code EMCTDWT25 to get the deal. And as usual with Newegg’s codes, you may have to subscribe to the company’s email newsletter for the code to work, although it’s still on sale for a decent $185 sans promo code.,As we noted in our ,, there are some negatives with this drive that are worth considering. For starters, it’s a QLC drive, which means its endurance is lower than most competing models. But unless you’re legitimately hammering the drive every single day for years on end, you shouldn’t have issues there; the 2TB model is rated to 400TBW, or about 220GB a day for the five years of the warranty.,The drive can also get very slow if you manage to fill up its SLC cache during extended massive write workloads. But unless you are moving massive file libraries from a similarly speedy second drive, or doing something similar demanding, you won’t likely run into that issue either. I’ve been using this specific drive in my main system every day for months and have been very happy with it. Sure, there are drives that are faster, but the 660p strikes a great balance of speed, features and performance, especially at this sale price."
WD’s Refreshed My Passport Lineup Features a Slim 5TB Portable Drive,"It’s not easy to make portable drives exciting, but Western Digital is doing its best today. WD has launched a refreshed My Passport line of drives that tops out with a 5 terabyte option that’s just 0.75 inch thick. By comparison,, is 0.8 inch thick. So while trimming off 0.05 inches isn’t exactly substantial, you do get 25% more storage in your pocketable ,.,As usual, WD will ship a My Passport for Mac model (in midnight blue, rather than tired silver), which comes with a removable USB-C cable. The black, light blue and red models (designed for Windows and other operating systems) will sport USB-A cables. All of the drives are USB 3.0, which is more than adequate to handle hard drive speeds. ,The new My Passport drives include access to software for password protection and 256-bit encryption, social media backup and cloud storage (Google Drive, Facebook and Dropbox) and other utilities. WD says the drives are available now, with a starting MSRP of $79.99 for the 1TB model. That’s pretty high compared to similar drives on the market. But given that the company’s ,, we expect street pricing of the new models to be similar."
Phison Brings Everspin’s 1Gb STT-MRAM To Next-Gen SSD Controllers,"The technology that never , even after , is advancing even farther into the enterprise market, thanks to a partnership that pairs , with ,.,Nonvolatile SST-MRAM offers similar performance to DRAM, but with slightly more latency, at densities that make it suitable for use as drive cache. For those of us who missed the point, Everspin explains “Phison controllers with Everspin’s 1 Gb STT-MRAM enable storage system designers to increase the reliability and performance of systems where high-performance data persistence is critical. This is accomplished by delivering protection against power loss without the use of supercapacitors or batteries.”"
"Toshiba Talks 5-Bit-per-Cell Flash, Demos First PCIe 4.0 Enterprise SSDs","Toshiba Memory had quite a bit going on at the Flash Memory Summit this year. Aside from the hustle and bustle of the company’s new , winning Best of Show, the company also had plenty of other leading-edge storage technology on display. With a few new PCIe 4.0 NVMe SSDs, the launch of XL-Flash Storage Class Memory (SCM), and some interesting Ethernet SSDs featuring native NVMe over fabrics (NVMe-oF), Toshiba is embracing PCIe 4.0 and new storage technologies. At the show, there was even mention of future BiCS FLASH, including Penta-level cell (PLC) NAND development.,At Toshiba’s keynote, the company’s speaker discussed not only the company's XL-Flash technology but also some interesting points on future developments.,Toshiba has already begun planning the fifth through seventh generations of its BiCS Flash. Each new generation will coincide with new generations of the PCIe standard, beginning with BiCS 5 that will come to market soon in alignment with PCIe 4.0, but the company hasn't provided a specific timeline. BiCS5 will feature higher bandwidth of 1,200MT/s, while BiCS6 will hit 1,600MT/s, and BiCS7 is slated to reach up to 2,000MT/s.,The company has also started research into Penta-level cell (PLC) NAND flash and actually verified working five-bit per cell NAND by modifying its current QLC NAND. The new flash provides more density with the ability to store five bits per cell, rather than just four in current QLC. But, to do this, the cell needs to be capable of storing 32 distinct voltage levels, and SSD controllers need to read them back accurately. With so many voltage levels to read to and write at nano-scale, the new technology is very challenging. To get control of the tighter thresholds, the company had to develop some additional processes that may adapt to its current TLC and QLC to boost performance.,QLC is already fairly slow and has lower endurance than other types of flash. PLC will have even less endurance and slower performance. New NVMe protocol features such as Zoned Namespaces (ZNS) should help mitigate some of the issues, however. ZNS by itself aims to reduced write amplification, reduce the need for media over-provisioning and internal controller DRAM usage, and of course, improve throughput and latency.,The company has developed a new process that increases die density in the next generations of BiCS FLASH in all forms. It essentially will split the memory cell in half to scale up while retaining the regular 3D flash process. Toshiba is not sure if this approach is entirely feasible at this time.,Toshiba announced ,. XL-Flash is Toshiba’s response to Samsung’s Low Latency V-NAND (aka Z-NAND) and Intel’s Optane memory. Because Optane is so expensive and Samsung’s solution is proprietary to its branded products, Toshiba saw an opportunity design a more cost-effective, lower latency storage solution for the company’s customers that bridges the gap between DRAM and NAND performance.,With what seems like a similar design to Samsung’s Low latency V-NAND, XL-Flash is a form of SLC NAND that has been optimized for the fastest response times. Initially, Toshiba will use the persistent memory in SSDs, but the company mentions possible use in non-volatile dual in-line memory modules (NVDIMMs) that ride on the DRAM bus. Sample devices are already built, and shipments will start in September. Toshiba expects mass production to begin in 2020.,Toshiba is the first company to announce and publicly demo enterprise/data center PCIe 4.0 SSDs. Built using company’s latest 96-layer BiCS4 flash, the all-new CM6 Series enterprise and CD6 Series data center SSDs clock in at speeds of up to 6.7 GB/s of sequential throughput.,The CD6 is built for cloud computing, content delivery networks (CDNs), and database applications while the CM6 is aimed towards HPC, big data analytics, containerized, and virtualization applications. Each comes in the new U.3 form factor (SFF-TA-1001) factor and are available in single port (CD6) and single/dual port (CM6) configurations. Additionally, they support the latest NVMe 1.4 specification.,With last year’s launch of KumoScale, a software that disaggregates high-performance NVMe SSDs from compute nodes and makes them shared and available across a network infrastructure as network-attached resources, Toshiba launched its embraced NVMe-oF.,Toshiba showed off an Ethernet JBOF box packed with 24 Ethernet SSDs. Each SSD appears in the system with an individual IP address for access over Ethernet. The production-ready prototype SSDs feature Toshiba’s 96L 3D NAND and utilize Marvell 88SN2400 NVMe-oF SSD controllers to create 25Gb Ethernet links rather than PCIe lanes.,NVMe-oF is quite an interesting and useful technology. It aims to bring low latency access over the fabric and expose the entire SSD’s bandwidth to the network as well as and mitigate the need for high PCIe lane allocations for storage deployment. So, those valuable lanes can be used for more important computational devices like GPUs and other accelerator cards, rather than local storage."
"Gigabyte's Aorus PCIe 4.0 SSD, Under the Hood at 5GB/s","Gigabyte has touched off the PCIe 4.0 SSD race with a tweet of a shadowy picture of its new M.2 Aorus NVMe Gen4 SSD, but that's just the beginning of the PCIe 4.0 SSD arms race. As the name implies, this new SSD is designed for a PCIe 4.0 connection, meaning that you'll need a ,-equipped system to unlock the full 5GB/s of throughput.,Gigabyte hasn't elaborated on 4K random performance, but given what we know about the SSD controller that is likely hiding under the hood, we can expect random performance to land in the 900,000 IOPS range for both reads and writes. There's also the possibility of capacities of 512GB, 1TB, and 2TB. That means Gigabytes Aorus SSD will be the fastest M.2 on the planet when it comes to market, but there are also even faster PCIe 4 SSDs coming next year.,The picture in Gigabyte's tweet shows a copper-looking heatsink over the drive, which would make sense for an enthusiast-oriented ,, and deducing the components underneath isn't too hard. Because Gigabyte doesn't make its own SSD controllers, it has three possible third-party controller companies to choose from: SMI, Phison, or Link_A_Media. Of the three, and only one has a working PCIe 4.0-compliant SSD that is production-ready: Phison.,Phison actually demoed its new E16 controller, the world's first PCIe 4.0 SSD controller, for us at ,. At the time Phison was still developing the E16 controller and had it paired with Micron's flash. That combination put out 4 GB/s of read throughput and 4.2 GB/s of write speed, but Phison told us those numbers would improve when Toshiba's BiCS4 flash became available. Given the 5GB/s spec for the Aorus SSD, it's likely we'll see BiCS4 on the SSD when it comes to market.,Gigabyte hasn't announced specifications for 4K random performance, but Phison told us at CES that the controller can hit up to 900,000 random read and write IOPS. Gigabyte also hasn't announced which capacities the SSDs will come in, but we know that Phison's reference design library, which most vendors base their SSDs on, includes 500GB, 1TB, and 2TB models. The 500GB model has lower write performance due to only coming with 16 flash die, while the 1TB and 2TB models come equipped with 32 die for the maximum performance in both read and write workloads.,Phison has beaten other SSD controller vendors to market by using its existing E12 controller engine paired with its own PCIe 4.0 PHY. That combination doesn't entirely saturate the PCIe 4.0 bus that boasts theoretical throughput of up to 8GB/s, but the E16 is just Phison's mid-range SSD controller. The company has a new high-end E19 controller coming in the Q1-Q2 2020 timeframe that will push the limits of the PCIe 4.0 x4 interface.,Phison is also switching from TSMC's 28nm process to TSMC's 12nm for the E19. The smaller process will boost performance and also help the company reduce power consumption, as the PCIe 4.0 bus is power hungry: The E16 pulls a maximum of 8W under load. The higher power consumption of PCIe 4.0 SSDs could slow adoption in mobile devices, but Phison is also bringing a lower-tier DRAMless SSD controller for M.2 2230 SSDs to market by the end of the year. The smaller manufacturing process, coupled with the lack of a DRAM chip, will help the company meet the stricter power requirements for laptops.,We expect to learn more details, such as pricing, capacities, and availability, here at Computex."
SK Hynix Returns To Retail SSD Market With Gold S31 SATA Drives,"SK Hynix announced this morning (August 16) that it's bringing a new line of SSDs out to play in the form of the SuperCore series, which will be available for customers soon. The first release in the new family will be the Gold S31, a 2.5-inch SATA drive that will range in capacity from 250GB to 1TB.,This marks the storied manufacturer's return to the retail market, with the introduction of the Gold S31 SSD based on the company's NAND and SSD controller, but there aren't a lot of details floating around about what to expect from it. There will be several other drives on their way as well, with 560MB/sec read and 525MB/sec write speeds that fall in line much with the other products on the market at present. Retail listings also confirm that the drives will feature DRAM as well.,SK Hynix was previously a serious contender in the SSD market alongside manufacturers like Samsung and Intel, all of whom have historically created their own products in-house and aimed them at consumers. SK Hynix was a member of the club for some time with its Canvas drives, but they never did receive their official North American debut. They've traditionally only been available via other, less upfront means, but as far as being sold through official channels, that's not yet come to fruition. Instead, they've been focusing on other tech, such as OEM drives.,If you're interested in picking up one of the new SK Hynix drives, they're being sold exclusively in North America via Amazon now, though next year will bring distribution via Europe and elsewhere. There also appears to be a new PCIe drive from the company by then as well, but SK Hynix has remained relatively mum about it.,You can pick up the 250GB drive for ,, the 500GB version ,, and the 1TB version , now."
Corsair's PCIe 4.0 Force Series MP600 SSD Hits 4.95 GB/s,"Corsair announced its new Force Series MP600 PCIe 4.0 SSD here at Computex in tandem with AMD's , reveal and X570 motherboard launch. When paired with a PCIe 4.0-capable system, the new drive delivers up to a beastly 4,950 MB/s of sequential read speed and 4,250 MB/s of write speed, or roughly ten times the sequential performance of any SATA SSD. ,That performance comes courtesy of Phison's E16 controller, first debuting at , which is currently the only PCIe 4.0 x4 controller on the market. Corsair paired the controller with an unspecified type of TLC flash, but we know that Phison's controller is currently only optimized for Toshiba's BiCS4 flash. (Phison will add support for Intel/Micron flash in the coming months).,You'll need to pair the SSD with a Third-gen Ryzen system to unlock the full speed of the drive, but luckily AMD is allowing vendors to enable PCie 4.0 backward compatibility with ,.,Corsair is rather light on the other details, such as sustained performance in heavy workloads, but the drive certainly shouldn't have throttling issues with the aggressively-styled finned heatsink. The company also isn't sharing random read and write performance, but we're sure to learn more closer to the launch in July 2019. The drive will be available worldwide through normal retail channels and carry a five-year warranty, but the company hasn't announced pricing. "
Boot Your PC at 15GB/s With Gigabyte's New PCIe 4.0 SSD Adapter,"The debut of AMD's third-gen Ryzen chips hastened the arrival of blazingly-fast PCIe 4.0 SSDs, but we'll soon be jaded about SSDs with a ""paltry"" 5GB/s of throughput, especially with new models coming with ,. But what if you could boot your PC with an SSD adapter that hits 15 GB/s?,That's the purpose of Gigabyte's prototype quad-SSD adapter. This new add-in card snaps into your PCIe slot to get access to the full blazing 64 GB/s of theoretical throughput available through the PCIe 4.0 x16 connection. After you add in the annoying, yet unavoidable overhead of the PCIe interface and RAID, Gigabyte's new prototype has hit up to 15 GB/s when paired with four of the company's new ,. Each of those SSDs hit up to 5GB/s, so the card could potentially push up to 20 GB/s with further tuning.,Using AMD's hardware RAID built into its motherboard, you can boot directly to this quad-SSD adapter if it's placed in the first PCIe slot. Snap in four SSDs, and you're ready to go. Currently the most capacious PCIe 4.0 SSDs come with 2TB of capacity, giving you an 8TB limit with the card, but that'll improve when more capacious SSDs come to market. ,Gigabyte's SSD adapter has a thick (and heavy) metal frontplate and backplate to keep the SSDs cool, while the blower-style fan exhausts air out of the rear of the case. The SSDs slot into the four standard M.2 sockets on the board and each has its own dedicated redriver to ensure top performance. The card is slot-powered, so you won't need to plug in any bulky power supply cables. This prototype has a switch on the upper left-hand corner that turns on some RGB bling, but Gigabyte decided not to include LED lighting on the final product. ,Gigabyte hasn't decided on final pricing for the adapter but expects that the combined cost of both the PCIe 4.0 SSDs and the adaptor will keep this out of the reach of most normal enthusiasts. Instead, Gigabyte plans to market the as-yet-unnamed card to the workstation market (hence the removal of the RGB lighting). ,The combination of PCIe 4.0's blazing throughput for storage devices with secondary PCIe 4.0 GPUs used for accelerated compute (like AMD's Radeon Instinct or Navi cards) will open up new levels of performance for creative professionals. Gigabyte is in the final stages of development, but hasn't finalized the launch date."
"Intel Drops Optane Memory M15 SSD, Higher Capacity and Boosted Performance","Intel announced its new Optane Memory M15 SSD today at Computex 2019. The new NVMe SSD comes with increased capacity and performance coupled with lower power consumption. This new product is an updated version of the Optane Memory M10 that is also designed to serve as a fast caching device for hard drives, thus blending the capacity and low pricing of hard drive storage with the speed of Intel's Optane memory.,The Optane Memory M15 addresses both the capacity and performance challenges associated with the first-gen products. The M15 comes with a doubled peak capacity of 64GB, but also comes in the same 16GB and 32GB capacities as its predecessor (all in an M.2 80mm form factor). Intel also widened the data pipe from a PCIe 3.0 x2 connection to x4, allowing access to twice the bandwidth. Intel's new proprietary controller doesn't fully saturate the bus though, but peak sequential read speeds improved by 550 MB/s, now reaching 2 GB/s, and write speed improves to 900 MB/s. Random performance also jumps considerably to 450,000/220,000 read/write IOPS.,Intel also improved the SSDs low power states, enabling faster transitions into and out of sleep mode and lowering the L1.2 deep sleep mode to a scant <5mW.,Other metrics, like the 365TBW endurance rating and five-year warranty, remain the same. The drive also supports Intel's existing software for the M10 series, so you can use the drive to accelerate both hard drives used as the operating system boot drive, or even secondary volumes.,The Optane Memory M15 seems to address some of the concerns of the relatively tiny (capacity wise) and limited performance of the first-gen models, but we don't have pricing or availability information yet. Stay tuned."
Report: Global NAND Flash Revenues See Sharp Decline,"A recent , revealed that the global NAND flash revenues declined sharply in the first quarter of 2019. The loss of revenues seems to be primarily due to server and smartphone OEMs seeing weakening demand for their products in the fourth quarter of 2018 and then adjusting their inventories downward for NAND flash in the first quarter of this year.,Contract prices for eMMC/UFS, client SSD and enterprise SSD fell by 15~20%, 17~31% and 26~32%, respectively, in Q1 2019.

Intel also saw the lowest decline in revenue (17.3%), followed by Micron, which saw a decline in revenues of 18.5% in Q1 2019. At the other end, SK Hynix’ revenues dropped by more than a third (35.5%).,Samsung, Micron, and Intel all saw bit shipments growth of 5%, 8%, and 10%, respectively. Meanwhile, SK Hynix, Toshiba and Western Digital experienced a decline in bit shipments. Intel, Micron and Toshiba were the only ones that were able to take advantage of the decline in prices to increase their market shares to the detriment of the other NAND flash suppliers.,Previous DRAMeXchange reports have said that SSD prices will continue to fall for the rest of the year, although the decline may slow down towards the end of the year. Prices are expected to drop ,.,Capacities are also , this year, as most of the players will be able to ship higher-density , in volume.

Western Digital Joins the Huawei Drop Party,"Western Digital today announced that it's severing ties with Huawei following the company's blacklisting by the U.S. Department of Commerce, according to ,, which reported that the storage company might reverse that decision if it's given the go-ahead from the U.S. government.,Losing access to Western Digital as a supplier will make it even harder for Huawei to manufacture its smartphones.

Seagate Brings 16TB Home/NAS and Data Center HDDs to Market,"Nearly a year ago Seagate announced its,, IronWolf and IronWolf Pro hard drive models. Just in case 14TB wasn’t enough, the vendor Monday announced 16TB drives in the Exos X16 for data center use and the IronWolf and IronWolf Pro models slated for Home/NAS use and optimal RAID performance.,Since traditional magnetic recording technologies have pushed drive densities to the edge, applying the TDMR (two-dimensional magnetic recording) technology increases the capacity even more. This method extends the capabilities of the traditional method, called Perpendicular Magnetic Recording, to increase capacity even more.,TDMR technology enables hard drive makers to increase areal density using narrower tracks and pitches. As these become smaller, they start to shows magnetic inter-track interference (ITI) which makes it increasingly more difficult for drive heads to perform read operations. In order to eliminate this effect, the TDMR technology uses an array of heads to read from either one, or several nearby tracks said to improve the signal-to-noise ratio sent to the controller. The use of multiple readers allow these controllers to figure out the correct data based on multiple input locations.,That tech, plus the sealed helium design allows for increases in areal density. This process Seagate says can yield not only 16TB drives, but up to 100 TB drives by 2025 raising capacity dramatically.This, along with the sealed helium design allows for increases in areal density. According to Seagate, this process can yield not only 16TB drives, but up to ,, thus raising capacity dramatically.,The IronWolf drives carry over their RV (Rotational Vibration) sensors, said to help the drive counteract vibrations in multi-bay enclosures, as well as including advanced power management features designed for NAS devices. It also comes with Seagate’s bundled Rescue Services for data recovery. Performance on these models are rated at 250 MB/s sustained transfer rates with its 256MB cache and 7,200 RPM spindle speeds. The IronWolf Pro includes a five-year warranty, while the non-pro version is three years with both sporting 1.2-million MTBF rating and workloads up to 300TB/year.,The Exos X16 drives deliver 33% more petabytes per rack compared to the 12TB drives while keeping the footprint reducing TCO in data center environments. The drives include Seagate Secure allowing for safe and secure driver erasure. Using 7,200 RPM rotational speeds and the same 256MB cache, the Exos X16 is capable of speeds up to 261 MB/s sustained transfer rates with random Read/Write 4K (QD16) IOPS listed at 170/440. MTBF is listed at 2.5-million hours and comes with a five-year warranty. It is worth noting the Exos is available in both SATA and SAS type drives. ,Some enterprise customers have already owned the Exos drives for a while now for vendor qualification and performance tests ahead of this week's general availability. The Exos X16 has an MSRP of $629. The IronWolf and IronWolf Pro are priced at $610 and $665, respectively. We should see more 16TB models hit the scene soon enough with Toshiba’s 16TB MG08 series unveiled at CES in January, along with Western Digital drives using the MAMR (as opposed to HAMR/TDMR) technology."
Speedy SSD Deal: Grab Samsung’s 500GB 970 EVO for Just $80,"Samsung consistently makes some of the best and fastest SSDs on the market. But they’re often priced so much higher than the competition, that they’re tough to recommend for value seekers. But the mainstream Samsung 970 EVO has been dropping in price lately, and Newegg has the lowest price we’ve seen for the 500GB model: $79.99. That’s $10 less than recent sales, and more than half off the initial street pricing of $200.,As with per usual with the best Newegg sales, you’ll have to be a newsletter subscriber for the above code to work (or if you are a subscriber, check your inbox for your own code). But even without the code, the drive is a pretty reasonably $89.99 right now.,Also keep in mind that this is an M.2 drive that runs over the PCIe bus and uses the NVMe protocol. So if your desktop or laptop only accepts SATA drives, this speedster won’t work for you. Data hoarders also take note: Newegg limits this deal to three drives per customer.,While the 970 EVO isn’t the new newest Samsung drive (the ,), this drive is still plenty speedy, with reasonably high endurance. It would make a great boot drive and/or game drive. Just remember that at 500GB, you won’t be able to install a ton of modern AAA titles.,For more current and upcoming deals on components and other electronics, be sure to check out our ,, as well as our feature ,."
Platform Storage Face-Off: AMD Upsets Intel,"Back in the early days of ,, Intel’s platforms provided consumers the fastest storage performance they could ask for. Hence, storage reviewers used mainstream Z-series platforms and i7 CPUs to extract the highest performance possible from the latest storage devices. We even initially began this article to demonstrate why this old trend continues.,However, recently, AMD’s platforms are really pulling ahead. If we consider the impact of ,, which punish storage performance under numerous circumstances and shaves off a lot of Intel's advantage, it seems the tables have turned in AMD's favor.,In contrast to our initial suspicions and historical data, storage performance on AMD platforms is actually now very comparable to Intel. As a matter of fact, the latest security patches seem to have turned raw storage benchmarks in favor of the red team. And we did our testing on the AMD side on X470. With the new , and , about to arrive, flush with ,, AMD's position on the storage front is likely to improve--at least after the platform irons out any early issues revolving around BIOS updates and drivers.,But, does that actually translate into real-world gains? Not so much, actually. When we add real-world workloads and applications into the mix, Intel usually comes out on top -- but not always. Let's dig into the testing to find out exactly what's going on.,We used similarly-equipped ASRock motherboards to reduce the number of variables in our testing. We’ve chosen two , motherboards. Both of these boards are a storage lover’s dream. They come decked out with eight SATA ports, multiple M.2 slots, 10GbE networking, and, of course, they feature their respective Z390 and X470 chipsets.,There is one important thing to note here, though. While the Z390 motherboard’s M.2 slots all operate at PCIe full 3.0 x4 bandwidth, not all will operate at that speed on the X470 motherboard. Instead, the last M.2 slot (furthest from the CPU) operates at PCIe 2.0 x4 speeds on most ,, cutting bandwidth in half. This slot isn’t the best choice if you’re looking for the best performance, but our benchmarks prove that giant cut in potential performance doesn’t always relate to much performance loss in real-world applications.,We decided to compare similarly-priced chips, but there are some tradeoffs. For the blue team, we have a ,. At $405, it is a bit pricey for an eight-core CPU without Hyper-Threading, but with a turbo frequency that stretches up to 4.9 GHz, it's quite the speedy slice of silicon. AMD has been at the forefront of offering more for less, so it should come as no surprise that we chose the $280 eight-core, 16-thread ,. It features double the usable threads, but boost clock frequencies are lower than Intel’s, topping out at just 4.3 GHz.,As per our standard testing procedure, we outfitted both systems with the same , cooler, MSI GT720 GPU, and Kingston HyperX Predator RGB 2x8GB 4000MHz CL19 memory kit running at 3,000 MHz.,We updated both motherboards to the latest UEFI version to patch up the latest rounds of vulnerabilities, bringing our systems up to UEFI 4.0 on the Z390 motherboard and UEFI 2.0 on the X470 motherboard. We also left both CPUs at stock clocks and disabled all the power saving features in the UEFI. This means no Speed Step, Speed Shift, Active State Power Management (ASPM), C-States, or P-States. We also disabled some optional controller chips, such as the LAN chips on both boards, and Thunderbolt 3 on the Z390 board.,We used 64-bit Windows 10 Pro. Like the UEFI, we updated to the latest version of Windows, v1809 – OS Build 17763.504, with all the latest security patches, including Meltdown, Spectre, and MDS mitigations. We also disabled Windows update, system restore, Windows Defender Antivirus, and the page file to reduce variances due to background processes.,We also installed the latest chipset drivers and Nvidia graphics driver. The X470 system froze repetitively on boot with the standard Nvidia driver delivered via Windows update (v388), so we had to manually install the latest revision (v430) to solve the issue.,We opted to use some of the most consistent SSDs available to test each type of Windows-bootable storage interface. To test the SATA interface, we used a 1TB ,. For the PCIe M.2 slots we used a 1TB ,, and we used the 1.5TB Intel , to test the PCIe slot.,The , benchmark is a free real-world game benchmark that easily and accurately compares game load times without the inaccuracy of a stopwatch.,AMD squashes Intel with a 1-2 second lead across the board. Surprisingly, Samsung’s 970 EVO Plus even outperformed the Intel 905P on the X470 chipset. Though the difference in load times between these two platforms is pretty minuscule, you may want to look to AMD if you want the absolute fastest game load times.,System boot was once a long and daunting task, but with the introduction of flash media, boot times now fly by. Here, we rebooted our system multiple times to find the average boot time. We did so with Windows 10’s fast boot feature enabled, Ultra-fast boot enabled in the UEFI, and a one-second POST delay enabled.,Boot times are among our most interesting results. As we'll show below, Intel’s platform displays higher application performance than AMD, but AMD's superior access performance seems to help during the boot process. The actual Windows load time was half a second faster on the AMD platform, but the Z390 system POSTed nearly four seconds faster, allowing it to triumph in total boot time. This tells us that AMD still needs to optimize the X470 platform's POST times.,We use the DiskBench storage benchmarking tool to test file transfer performance with our own custom 50GB block of data. Our data set includes 31,227 files of various types, like pictures, PDFs, and videos. We copy the files to a new folder and then follow up with a read test of a newly-written 6 GB file.,File transfer speeds are more reflective of real-world performance than our synthetic testing below. Intel’s system came out on top more often than not when we moved actual files around. The Optane 905P copied our 50GB test folder to and from itself faster on the AMD system than it did on the Intel system, but it was the opposite for the 970 EVO and 860 EVO. All drives tested on the Intel platform also read the files faster.,PCMark 8 is a trace-based benchmark that uses Microsoft Office, Adobe Creative Suite, ,, and , to measure the performance of storage devices in real-world scenarios.,As we saw in our DiskBench testing, while our Intel system falls behind AMD in the synthetic testing below, working with real data is entirely different. In PCMark 8, the Samsung 970 EVO Plus’ performance improved 7% when operating on the Intel platform, and the Intel 905P improved by 16%. SATA results revealed very little difference between the two in real-world tests, and so did going from a PCIe 3.0 x4 link to a PCIe 2.0 x4 link.,Like PCMark, SYSmark uses real applications to measure system performance. SYSmark takes things much further, however. It utilizes fourteen different applications to run real workloads with real data sets to measure how overall system performance impacts the user experience. BAPCo's SYSmark 2014 SE installs a full suite of applications for its tests, which includes Microsoft Office, Google Chrome, Corel WinZip, several Adobe software applications, and GIMP. That also makes it a great test to measure the amount of time it takes to install widely-used programs after you install a fresh operating system.,While AMD has a clear advantage in creativity tasks where applications favor more cores and threads-our Intel system outperforms it in the productivity test even though it has fewer threads. It seems Intel’s architecture and/or higher clock rates help boost office application performance over our AMD system. But the AMD system was faster in productivity and task responsiveness, and it nailed the highest overall score. Even though the AMD system wins here, let’s not forget that both systems perform within 1-4% of one another, so differences are slight.,CrystalDiskMark (CDM) is a simple and easy to use file size benchmarking tool.,This benchmark allows us to see both sequential and random performance at various queue depths, so it is quite helpful to illustrate the difference between the two platforms.,Overall synthetic performance falls in favor of our X470 system. With a 200-300 MB/s lead over our Intel system with PCIe devices, the AMD platform delivers higher sequential speeds, even at a QD of 1. On the AMD system, the Samsung 970 EVO Plus had an 18-25% advantage in sequential read/write performance, and the Intel 905P was 10-12% faster. If you happen to pop your M.2 into the PCIe 2.0 x4 M.2 slot on your X470 motherboard, you’ll get about 1.6/1.5 GB/s of read/write performance, at best.,AMD's SATA performance is also 7% better at QD1. When we intensified the load to a queue depth (QD) of 32, however, the Intel system was comparable and all devices hit their rated specs, but we caution that this isn't a realistic workload.,Random performance at QD1, which is by far the most important synthetic measurement due to its relationship to system snappiness, seems to be in AMD’s favor yet again. Intel’s 905P delivered 34% faster read performance and 35% better write performance on the X470 motherboard. The Samsung 970 EVO Plus had 20% more random read performance and an astonishing 61% improvement in random write performance at QD1. SATA performance is also better on the X470 platform. The Samsung 860 EVO was 1,000 IOPS faster during the read test and 40% faster during the QD1 write test.,We bumped up the load to QD64, using eight threads at QD8 apiece, and AMD won yet again. This time, however, it seems likely due to the extra thread count from AMD’s Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT) feature, which is similar to Hyper-Threading. The lack of Hyper-Threading on the Core i7 limits its ability to keep up with the application and actually bottlenecks our storage performance results: The -9700K’s CPU usage was maxed out while the 2700X was running with room to spare. The result is a massive 120,000 IOPS read and 126,000 IOPS write improvement with the Intel 905P on the AMD system. With all this taken into consideration, it’s quite refreshing to see AMD’s platform make Intel sweat a little on the storage side.,AMD has come a long way with its Ryzen architecture. Team Red now tramples on Intel during synthetic tests. Interestingly enough, however, while synthetic storage performance has shifted in AMD’s favor, and at some points it was surprising to see just how much of a lead it has, our application benchmarks show the two trade blows depending on the specific task and interface. Performance with SATA SSDs proved roughly the same overall, which was great to see.,This is why we always carry out comparisons with results based upon the same system. Although the Intel i7 9700K lacks the additional eight threads that the Ryzen 7 2700X has, its architecture with faster Turbo frequencies made it come out on top in productivity, even with the latest vulnerability mitigations. And in PCMark 8, our Intel system enjoyed a 7-16% lead with PCIe SSDs, and the Intel system boots faster overall.,But, let’s not leave value out of the perspective nor forget just how small the differences were in both tests. In terms of value, our AMD system can’t be matched. While AMD's dominance in synthetics didn’t correlate to wins in all of our real-world application tests, AMD’s platform is still quite competitive. The 2700X's extra threads pushed out higher IOPS and even outperformed Intel in SYSmark 2018.,Game loading times also went in favor of the AMD platform. Surprisingly enough on that front, AMD’s platform even allowed the 1TB Samsung 970 EVO Plus to outperform the $2,200 1.5TB Intel Optane SSD 905P. But this doesn’t mean the AMD system is faster than the Intel system during actual gameplay.,If you're looking to make a purchase, storage performance shouldn't sway you too much in either direction. If you are looking for the best performance in office productivity tasks or normal day-to-day file transfers, Intel is usually going to be the winner, and games are still going to run faster. This comes at a significantly higher cost, however, and there is still the risk of further performance-killing mitigations.,If you're concerned about value, AMD wins hands down. Even if storage performance is your main main consideration, we just can’t justify spending $100-$200 more on an Intel chip for so little difference in storage performance over AMD’s Ryzen 7 2700X and all of its eight-core, 16-thread goodness.,We're of course also interested to see how storage shakes out on the , with new , that are scheduled to arrive in July, along with support for ,. While the , may move the value needle a little, especially if ,, it seems likely that AMD will pull further ahead on storage this year--even if it's just thanks in large part to support for ,. "
SanDisk Expands Extreme Pro NVMe SSD Line to 2TB,"As per SanDisk Japan's ,, the flash memory manufacturer has expanded its , family of high-performance M.2 NVMe , with a new 2TB drive.,The Extreme Pro 2TB is an , that respects the NVMe 1.3 protocol and communicates with your system through a standard ,M.2 port. Like its siblings, the drive uses SanDisk's in-house eight-channel, three-core SSD controller and 64-layer 3D TLC (triple-level cell) NAND flash memory. SanDisk Japan didn't list the SSD's DRAM capacity. The Extreme Pro 2TB is equipped with SanDisk's latest nCache 3.0 feature, which is a caching technology that reportedly drives up sequential and random performance.,The 2TB drive offers sequential read and write speeds up to 3,400 MBps and 2,900 MBps, respectively. The SSD delivers for 480,000 IOPS random reads and 550,000 IOPS random writes. The 2TB model also has the best endurance of all three models.

NASty: QNAP Warns Users About 'eCh0raix' Ransomware,"QNAP, a Taiwan-based network-attached storage (NAS) vendor, warned its NAS customers to make sure they're using strong passwords, have the latest version of its QTS firmware installed and are staying vigilant about their device's security in response to Anomali's disclosure of the eCh0raix Ransomware earlier this month.,IT security firm Anomali ,. The ransomware appears to be fairly standard: it compromises QNAP devices ""by brute forcing weak credentials and exploiting known vulnerabilities in targeted attacks,"" before a ""malicious payload encrypts the targeted file extensions on the NAS using AES encryption and appends .encrypt extension to the encrypted files."" That's where the ransom comes in.,The ransom note instructs victims to visit a website using the Tor browser for more information about retrieving their files. Most security companies advise ransomware victims not to pay the ransom; the attackers have little motivation to hold up their end of the bargain. ,According to Anomali, eCh0raix specifically targeted publicly accessible NAS from QNAP that weren't located in Belarus, Ukraine, or Russia, potentially because the attackers operate in one of those countries. The best mitigation against this attack, the company said, would be to restrict external access to the device while also following QNAP's advice regarding strong credentials and firmware updates.,QNAP , related to eCh0raix on July 11. Here are the company's recommendations:,QNAP also said that it's ""urgently working on a solution to remove malware from infected devices and will release it at the soonest possible time."" Anyone who owns a QNAP product can reach out to the company via the , for additional information about eCh0raix, protecting their devices, etc. In the meantime, this is simply another reminder to be diligent about strong passwords and firmware updates."
Microsoft Demonstrates Automated DNA Storage,"If countless procedural crime shows have taught us anything, it's that DNA can hold a veritable ton of information just waiting to be accessed by a bunch of people wearing lab coats who like to squint at pipettes. Microsoft wants to take advantage of those capabilities using synthetic DNA, and earlier this week, the company announced that it'd demonstrated the first fully automated DNA data storage system in a proof of concept test.,That test sounds deceptively simple: researchers from Microsoft and the University of Washington encoded the word ""hello"" in synthetic DNA and then converted it back to digital data with a fully automated system. Existing systems can handle important parts of that process, but as Microsoft explained in its announcement, ""many of the intermediate steps until now have required manual labor in the research lab."" This one doesn't.,Automating these processes is crucial to enabling the use of synthetic DNA as a storage mechanism at scale. Microsoft said that DNA ""could fit all the information currently stored in a warehouse-sized datacenter into a space roughly the size of a few board game dice."" But no company's going to bother with those information-loaded dice if retrieving the data they hold is a time-consuming process that relies on manual labor.,That's why the company said that ""costs need to decrease for both synthesizing DNA — essentially custom building strands with meaningful sequences — and the sequencing process that extracts the stored information"" if using synthetic DNA as a storage mechanism is going to work. Because human workers are so expensive (who'd have thunk?) automating these processes will be vital to making them more affordable.,Here's a video about the demo:,And here's how the system demonstrated by Microsoft and UW brings automation to this field:,""The automated DNA data storage system uses software developed by the Microsoft and UW team that converts the ones and zeros of digital data into the As, Ts, Cs, and Gs that make up the building blocks of DNA. Then it uses inexpensive, largely off-the-shelf lab equipment to flow the necessary liquids and chemicals into a synthesizer that builds manufactured snippets of DNA and to push them into a storage vessel."",When that information needs to be retrieved, Microsoft said, the system then ""adds other chemicals to properly prepare the DNA and uses microfluidic pumps to push the liquids into other parts of the system that 'read' the DNA sequences and convert it back to information that a computer can understand."" The researchers are also working on a system meant to automate (and thus reduce the cost of) lab experiments.,Does that mean we're close to loading up our systems with synthetic DNA instead of traditional storage mechanisms? Not really. Most people want their storage to hold more than the word ""hello,"" and while other researchers are working on figuring out how we can enable more complex processes using DNA, it's probably going to take a little while for the technology to reach consumers. Microsoft's demo merely helped that process along."
"Intel Optane DIMM Pricing: $695 for 128GB, $2595 for 256GB, $7816 for 512GB (Update)"," Colfax Direct reached out with its pricing for the modules, including the 512GB Optane DC Persistent DIMMs. We've added the updated pricing below.,Intel's Optane memory can be used as either , or storage, and it turns out to be pretty competitively priced. Intel's newly released , slot right into a DDR4-compliant memory slot and promise to fundamentally upset the conventional memory hierarchy as we know it, making memory persistent so it doesn't lose data when it loses power. It also boosts memory capacity up to an astounding 512GB per slot. If that's too much memory for you, Intel also offers 128GB and 256GB sticks.,Unfortunately, this radical new memory is only designed for servers, at least for now, but it is significantly cheaper than ,. Intel designed the DIMMs to bridge both the performance and pricing gap between storage and memory but hasn't released official pricing for the new memory yet, instead giving us rough estimates for system-level pricing that often includes volume discounts for OEMs. However, now the Optane DIMMs have popped up at online retailers Colfax Direct, CompSource, and ShopBLT, giving us our first glimpse of retail pricing.,Colfax Direct has posted pricing for the 512GB modules at $8,250, while the 128GB DIMMs weigh in at ~$695, which is significantly cheaper than CompSource and ShopBLT. The 256GB models command a $2,595 price point. ShopBLT also has the 512GB DIMMs listed at $7,816.,Equipping a full server with this kit is pricey, though. Intel outfitted its example configurations with a copious amount of capacity: twelve 128GB sticks weigh in at a total of $6,924. Stepping up to twelve 512GB sticks pushes the needle up to $81,012, but this is relatively tame pricing compared to what you'd pay for an equivalent amount of DRAM.,For instance, even with the currently low DRAM pricing, the highest-capacity 128GB , DDR4 sticks are roughly $4,500 apiece, making the ~$850 asking price for Optane look particularly attractive. New 256GB DRAM sticks are coming to market soon, and pricing hasn't been announced, but you can also expect them to land at significantly higher prices than the Optane DIMMs. Finally, there is no option on the near horizon for 512GB DRAM modules.,And that's one of the key value propositions of Intel's ultra-dense modules: DRAM simply can't match Optane's density, so you really only have one option for the ultimate in memory density. Optane enables a total of up to 6.5TB of Optane memory in a single dual-socket server, provided you have a ,.,That said, Intel's Optane DIMMs aren't as fast as DRAM, and they still require at least one DRAM stick in the server. Due to the nature of Intel's Optane, not all workloads will benefit equally from the speedy medium, but they do provide tangible benefits for many workloads. ,, the new memory technology behind Optane, is fast enough to serve as a slower tier of DRAM, but it does require tuning the application and driver stacks to accommodate its unique characteristics.,DRAM also has unlimited endurance (with a few caveats), whereas Optane DIMMs are only warrantied for five years of full-on abuse. Intel says that it bases this endurance rating on the maximum possible throughput to the DIMMs for the duration of five years, putting to rest any endurance concerns. Intel also encrypts all data stored on the DIMMs to protect user data.,Overall, the DIMMs consume about three times the power of a standard 8/16GB DDR4 DIMM. Power consumption is a huge consideration in the data center, and gaining 32 times the memory capacity in exchange for three times increase the power consumption is a dramatic improvement.,Wrapping these advantages in a price-friendly package is a game changer, but there are several caveats to the new Optane DC Persistent Memory DIMMs. We're currently working on a full review of the new memory, so stay tuned for more details."
Intel Receives Injunction Against Former Employee Who Joined Micron,"The hardest part of any breakup is figuring out who gets what. For most couples that means divvying up furniture, decorations and other fairly trivial stuff. It's a lot more complicated when tech workers split with their employers, as demonstrated by Intel and a former engineering manager who now works at Micron.,Intel feared that the manager, Doyle Rivers, could share information about 3D XPoint and Optane with his new employer. But , reported today that the chipmaker has received a preliminary injunction against Rivers that prohibits him from possessing, using, or disclosing any of that info.,The , gives Rivers three business days to return any confidential data in his possession. It's not clear how that order's affected by Rivers' lawyers' claim that some information--including the personnel list at the crux of Intel's complaint--isn't really confidential. ,One a Rivers' lawyers told The Register that the order was mutually agreed upon because Rivers ""doesn't have anything to return."" The lawyer, Alto Litigation's Daniel Sakaguchi, also said he and Rivers ""continue to take the position that Intel's claims are greatly exaggerated."" (Typical breakup smack-talk.),Those claims are numerated in Intel's lawsuit against Rivers filed in November. They include allegations that Rivers attempted to copy a ""top secret"" file after secretly accepting the job at Micron. That effort was said to be unsuccessful, but Intel claimed that Rivers copied ""a highly sensitive compilation of Intel personnel information."" This info could be used to poach vital Intel employees.,From there, it devolves into a he-said corporate-entity-said. Rivers' lawyers, according to The Register, said a list of employees isn't actually a trade secret. (An argument supported realistically, if not legally, by the fact that LinkedIn exists.) It's up to the court to decide whether or not that's the case.,Sometimes companies have to make sure their workers don't take any sensitive information to their new employer. But this particular case is probably exacerbated by the fact that Intel , on 3D XPoint and Optane. It's a breakup within a breakup with a lot of IP involved. "
Intel Optane vs Samsung Z-NAND: SSD Memory Face-Off,"In 2019, there’s just no reason to boot a PC off of ,. And, if you care about performance, you’ll want a drive that uses the speedy NVMe interface and the best possible ,. While most SSDs still use some form of NAND flash, Intel and Samsung have developed their own high-speed alternatives in the form of Optane (aka 3D Xpoint) and Z-NAND, respectively.,At this point, only a handful of Intel-branded SSDs use Optane memory and a pair of Samsung enterprise drives have Z-NAND. But if you’re seeking the , performance money can buy, a drive using one of these technologies should be on short list.,So which is better? To find out, we put the Optane and Z-NAND through a seven-round face-off, using numbers from 960GB capacities of the , and ,. But first, let’s take a look at how these memory types work.,Intel’s Optane is the first solid-state memory based on the 3D XPoint technology Team Blue developed in cooperation with Micron (Micron plans to come out with its own 3D XPoint-based devices later this year). In Optane, submicroscopic layers of material are cut into columns leaving each column with a memory cell and selector. Then wires are perpendicularly connected to the top and bottom of the columns to make up the crosspoint structure.,Unlike conventional NAND, this memory doesn’t store electrons in a charge trap or floating gate array to hold bits of information. Instead, a 1 or an 0 is designated based on the cell material’s resistance level. The memory cells can be individually addressed by selecting one wire on top and one on the bottom. They are then read or written to by varying the amount of voltage sent to each selector. This causes a bulk property change which results in the material changing the cell to a high or low resistance state and is a huge factor as to why it is so fast.,Because 3D XPoint can be individually addressed, there is no need for garbage collection, the read-modify-write process that helps to reclaim occupied cells where data was deleted. Since garbage collection eats up the devices' compute resources, the lack of it makes Optane faster than NAND under write heavy workloads. Along with its material properties, it also helps Optane withstand significantly more writes over its lifetime and exhibit a much lower latency profile.,Samsung’s Z-NAND (aka Low Latency V-NAND) is that company’s answer to Optane. While Z-NAND is burdened with many of the same drawbacks as normal flash to some extent, its design enables performance that is closer to that of 3D XPoint than normal NAND.,Built off of a modified V-NAND design, Z-NAND currently utilizes 48 layers and functions in single level cell (SLC) mode, so each cell can only have a charge level of a 1 or a 0. MLC, TLC, and QLC NAND all have more voltage states which reduce performance and endurance. Thus, they need more powerful and complex ECC algorithms in order to prevent data read errors and are slower.,Z-NAND features page sizes as small as 2-4 KB where normal NAND pages are 8-16 KB. This, in turn, helps to provide more parallelism so that the drive can read and write smaller chunks of data at a faster pace. It also helps reduce latency.,We’ve all been there.  You click on an application or file, watching a spinning circle logo, and a few moments later it finally opens. SSDs with traditional NAND offer significantly lower latency than a traditional HDD, which helps make requests nearly instant, but Z-NAND and 3D XPoint drives are even better.,At a QD of 1, a 4KB random read/write request on the 983 ZET has a latency of about 0.023-0.024ms, or something that is about 1/4th that of regular SSDs. The 3D XPoint based Intel Optane SSD 905P, however, is much better with a latency of 0.017ms.,And, on top of that, it is able to maintain that low latency during both reads and writes. The only time the 983 ZET outperformed the 905P was outperformed was during 4K random reads at QD32 and up, and during sequential read or write workloads., Intel Optane. Since most enterprise workloads are around the QD 1-16 range and are often mixed in nature, we award this round to Intel. Optane is the lowest latency storage medium we have tested to date.,Because it doesn’t need to perform garbage collection, the Intel 905P delivers fast and consistent IOPS, and thus, makes random performance Optane’s strong suit. Whether during during pure reads or writes, or a mix of both, Optane delivers some of the fastest performance we’ve seen non-stop at queue depths where it matters.,At a QD of 1, the Intel Optane SSD 905P delivered 58/53k IOPS read/write, and at QD4, about quadruple that. At a QD of 128 it maxed out at ~580K IOPS read/write. It even attained an average of 526K IOPS during a 70/30% read/write mix.,While random performance is 3D XPoint’s specialty, the 983 ZET with its Z-NAND is no slouch, though. Z-NAND takes the win at high QDs of 32 and beyond. At QD 128 it delivers nearly 800K IOPS while the Optane 905P delivers 580K IOPS.,At QD1-4, the Samsung drive’s performance is close to the 905P, but once you throw in some writes, performance trails behind 3D XPoint and is rather limited to a max of 75K IOPS. The SZ985 can deliver up to 170K IOPS write, but that is still nowhere near the Intel 905P’s 580K IOPS write performance., Intel Optane.  When it comes to consistent random performance, Intel’s memory delivers where others can’t.,Sequential performance matters most when you have multi-GB sized files and you want to access or move them around. Even most games’ file loading is sequential in nature.  Here, the Z-NAND based drives have an edge over their Optane-based competitors.,We’re not quite sure if it is due to the controller or the memory itself that limits the Intel Optane SSDs, but most are limited to sequential throughput of about 2.5-2.7GB/s. The 983 ZET uses Samsung’s consumer-class Phoenix SSD controller, which enables sequential speeds of up to 3.4GB/s. Even at a QD of 1, Samsung’s Z-NAND based SSD is able to outperform the Intel 905P with reads/writes at 2-2.1GB/s., Samsung Z-NAND. With superior sequential read/write performance, Samsung’s Z-NAND wins this round.,One of the most frustrating parts of PC gaming is sitting there tapping your thumbs and waiting for levels to load. To find out which storage technology is best for gaming, we used the , test, which is a free real-world game benchmark that easily and accurately compares game load times, no stopwatch required.,With the ability to dish out nearly 800K random read IOPS and sequential throughput of up to 3.5GB/s in consumer products, Samsung’s Phoenix controller is quite capable. It is only natural to expect strong game load performance after seeing its stats.,But, we didn’t think the 983 ZET would actually beat Intel’s 905P. Here, we see that Z-NAND is able to outperform Intel’s 3D XPoint ever so slightly due to faster sequential performance, where the 905P is somewhat limited., Samsung Z-NAND. With better sequential read performance at QD1, the 983 ZET was able to outperform Intel’s Optane SSD 905P in game scene loading.,For productivity comparison, we used two very well-known software suites. The first is PCMark 8’s trace-based Storage Test 2.0. This test utilizes Microsoft Office, Adobe Creative Suite, ,, and , to measure the performance of storage devices in real-world scenarios. The other is SYSmark 2014 SE, an application-based test, similar to PCMark 8, but it utilizes more applications and even has multiple operations going on at once in order to paint a more realistic picture of performance.,In PCMark 8, both the 983 ZET and 905P deliver incredibly high scores. The 983 ZET scored 5,140 points and an average bandwidth of 1423MB/s. Intel’s 905P, however still bested it with a score of 5144 points and an average bandwidth of 1609MB/s.,SYSmark 2014 SE shows a similar result. While the 983 ZET scored higher than any other NAND based drive we have tested, Intel’s 905P still outperformed it ever so slightly by three points., Intel Optane. Even with lower sequential performance, Intel’s memory proves that its ultra-low latency and high random IOPS at low queues makes it the fastest storage medium when you want to get things done.,The one drawback to SSD technology is that all drives can only absorb a limited number of writes before they eventually wear out. For most consumers, who write in the range of 10 to 20GB a day, it would take many years to wear out even the cheapest NAND-based SSD. However, large businesses that want to use SSDs in servers or workstations have tougher endurance requirements.,The good news is that both Optane and Z-NAND-based products have incredible endurance figures. The Samsung 983 ZET and Intel Optane SSD 905P share the same endurance rating of about 17.5 Petabytes written (PBW). To put that into perspective, that's about two centuries worth of consumer writes (20GB/day * 365 days/year * 2000 years = 14.6 PB). Basically, both can take almost any workload you throw at it for as long as you need.,Stretching out to the enterprise grade Intel Optane DC P4800X, we can see that it features an endurance rating of 41 PBW at the 750GB capacity. As well, the ZET’s bigger brother, the Samsung ZS985, can absorb a very similar amount of writes too, up to 43.8 PBW at the 800GB capacity.,However, when looking to smaller 375GB and 480GB capacities of 3DXPoint and Z-NAND based products, we can see that Intel’s DC P4800X can withstand almost three times the number of writes than the 983 ZET, and the 905P at 480GB can withstand a little over a PB more of data written, too., Both storage mediums demonstrate very high endurance and trade blows depending on the final product and capacity.,Power consumption is an important piece of the puzzle when it comes to your computer hardware, even storage. You wouldn’t want a storage device drawing as much power as a , or ,, would you?,Luckily that is not the case quite yet, but in the past few years, we have seen our fair share of power-thirsty SSD devices. At the 960GB capacity, the Intel Optane 905P consumes upwards of 15W. The 960GB Samsung 983 ZET, on the other hand, consumes approximately half of that at 7.5-8W on average.,But, while the Z-NAND device consumes less power, the sheer performance of Optane plays a huge role in its efficiency. Once you work in random write workloads, the 905P is capable of delivering 2-4x the efficiency of Z-NAND. However, in any other metric, Z-NAND comes out on top.,In pure sequential workloads the 983 ZET can deliver performance of upwards of 350-430MB/s per watt, and in random read workloads, upwards of 100K IOPS per W. Intel’s Optane SSD 905P delivers half of that. In our simple 50GB file copy test of the two, the 983 ZET came out on top as the victor too., Samsung Z-NAND. Intel’s Optane offers better random efficiency under pure and mixed write workloads, but overall, Samsung’s Z-NAND offers better efficiency, especially in sequential and random read workloads.,While each has its pros and cons, we don’t necessarily have a winner after today’s bout.,Intel’s Optane is a game-changing memory technology. It exhibits great endurance, ultra-low latency, and is free of the drawbacks of NAND flash. It even has a high price to match its throne. But, Intel’s controller of choice in their Optane based products could use some improvements.,For starters, Team Blue needs to push sequential speed in their next-gen Optane SSD products and kick things up a notch in random read performance. It is amazing that they are able to deliver over 500K IOPS from a consumer product, even under a 70/30% read/write mix, but NAND-based solutions scale higher during heavy load.,Not only that, but with Optane, idle power consumption and overall power consumption is much higher than NAND-based products at the same capacity point, although incredible performance makes up for it somewhat when you look to its efficiency.,Samsung’s optimization of SLC NAND flash is quite impressive, too. With similar low QD read performance and strong sequential throughput, it can keep up with Optane in many workloads. It is also quite power efficient. And while not as expensive, it is still pricey and comes with some performance compromises that 3D XPoint lives without.,With the emergence of other vendors working on their own alternatives to 3D XPoint, who knows what will come. Maybe we will be doing a bout against WD’s ReRAM next time.,Want to comment on this face-off? ,."

"Micron Launches the 1300, Refreshing With 96-Layer 3D TLC Flash","Micron has added a new consumer SATA SSD to the company's storage arsenal. The latest Micron 1300 SSD features 96-layer 3D TLC (triple-level cell) NAND flash chips and comes as an upgrade to the company's existing 1100 series.,Micron offers the new 1300 SATA SSD in conventional 2.5-inch and M.2 formats. Independent of the form factor, the Micron 1300 comes with the same feature set and level of performance.,In terms of features, the Micron 1300 boasts support for device sleep (DEVSLP) low-power mode, asynchronous power-loss protection, adaptive thermal monitoring, Garbage Collection, and S.M.A.R.T. Since the Micron 1300 utilizes an XTS AES-256-bit hardware engine, the manufacturer also offers optional features, such as Opal 2.0 self-encryption, to protect your valuable data without compromising the SSD's performance.,The Micron 1300 is available in capacities of 256GB, 512GB, 1TB, and 2TB (only available in 2.5-inch format). On the performance front, the drive delivers sequential read and write speeds of up to 530 MB/s and 520 MB/s, respectively. The 256GB model has a random read speed of 58,000 IOPS while the higher-capacity models are rated for 90,000 IOPS. Random write performance is rated at 87,000 IOPS across all models.,The 256GB and 512GB model have an endurance rating of 180 and 300 TBW (Terabytes Written), although the 1TB and 2TB models flaunt a 400 TBW rating. In low-power mode, the Micron 1300 drives draw 5 milliwatts (except the 2TB drive, which consumes 10 milliwatts).,Micron markets the 1300 SSD as an accessible path for hard drive owners to transition over to a SSD. However, the storage manufacturer hasn't revealed pricing or availability."
"QNAP Releases 25GbE, 10GbE Network Expansion Cards","QNAP released new dual-port 25GbE and 10GbE network expansion cards (NECs) for use in high-end PCs and NAS setups. They're called the QXG-25G2SF-CX4 and QXG-10G2SF-CX4, respectively, and they're meant to help professionals manage a ton of data.,As QNAP product manager Dan Lin explained in ,: “Cloud, big data, high-speed storage, virtualization, and AI are strongly pushing 25GbE into the mainstream. QNAP now provides users with a scalable solution for adopting 25GbE infrastructure by leveraging the industry-leading Mellanox Ethernet solution to deliver a next-gen 25GbE NIC for NAS, servers and workstations."",It's no secret that consumers and companies have both grown increasingly data-hungry. Content starts taking up more space as movies and games catch up with higher resolutions. More information is being tracked digitally. And artificial intelligence requires the use of massive amounts of data. All that leads to more demands of storage devices' performance than ever.,Both of the new NECs are built with a Mellanox ConnectX-4Lx controller, utilize a PCIe Gen 3 x8 interface, and come with a low-profile bracket pre-installed. They're also compatible with QNAP's QTS as well as Windows and Linux. (Provided you install the appropriate driver for each model.) The 25GbE version relies on an SFP28 connection; the 10GbE version uses an SFP+ connection.,Even QNAP notes on the 25GbE model's product page that ""25GbE NICs are designed for data-intensive applications and enterprise IT environments."" The company said reaching the product's full potential requires ""at least three workstations with Intel Core i5/i7 processors (or similar) at 3.3 GHz (or higher) and NVMe SSDs"" as well as a similarly specced QNAP NAS loaded with SSDs.,The 10GbE model is probably more suited to home use. But it only costs $20 less than the 25GbE model, and we suspect that most enthusiasts would rather spend that twenty bucks to get an extra 15Gb/s of potential performance just to be on the safe side. Who knows when storage needs will need to be adjusted, right? (Eh, who are we kidding, we just like higher performance numbers.),QNAP is selling the , for $287 from its Accessories Store with a two-three day wait time. The , is also available now for $267 with the same waiting period. Both models are backed by one-year limited warranties."
Samsung to Manufacture Industry-First 512GB eUFS 3.0 Drive,"Samsung announced that it would begin mass production of the world’s first 512GB embedded Universal Flash Storage drive for next-generation smartphones. The company also plans to manufacture a 1TB eUFS 3.0 drive by the end of the year.,Samsung’s 512GB drive doubles the capacity of previous eUFS drives. The eUFS 3.0 standard is also rated at twice the sequential read performance of the previous-generation eUFS 2.1 drives, reaching up to 2,100 Mbps. This is four times the speed of SATA 3 SSDs and 20x the typical speed of a microSD, according to Samsung. The sequential write speed is rated at 410 Mbps, which is roughly the speed of a SATA 3 SSD.,Random read and write speeds have also increased by 36% over the previous eUFS 2.1 generation, reaching 63,000 and 68,000 Input/Output Operations Per Second (IOPS), respectively. According to the company, this is 630 times faster than lower-end microSD cards that can ship with only 100 IOPS of performance.,Over the past few years, the industry has begun the switch to the newer and more modern UFS memory standard over eMMC for both internal storage and external memory cards. Samsung has been at the forefront of this switch, releasing both internal and external drives based on the UFS memory standard.,As the eMMC standard was reaching its limits, the JEDEC Association released the UFS standard to help embedded flash products reach the speeds of SSDs. The latest , was able to reach only 250Mbps sequential read and 125 Mbps sequential write speeds, while the second generation UFS standard was able to almost double those numbers.,Since then, UFS 2.1 and now UFS 3.0 have left the eMMC 5.1 standard behind in terms of performance, which is why more industry players should increase the adoption of the new standard in the coming years and completely abandon the eMMC standard."
Micron Reducing Production Amid 'Worse-Than-Expected CPU Shortages',"Micron released its Q2 2019 financial results yesterday. As reported by ,, Micron plans to cut its production of DRAM and NAND flash chips by 5 percent in 2019. The company also showed caution for Q3 sales.,""Our demand outlook for calendar 2019 has moderated, led by somewhat greater levels of customer inventory, weakening server demand at several enterprise OEM customers and worse-than-expected CPU shortages,"" Micron CEO and president Sanjay Mehrotra said in an ,. ""We believe macroeconomic uncertainty is also contributing to hesitation in buying behavior at some customers. However, as we discussed on our last earnings call, we still expect DRAM bit shipments to begin increasing in our fiscal Q3, with demand growth strengthening in the second half of calendar 2019 as most customer inventories are likely to normalize by mid-year."",Micron, , before it, is reducing production as current demand fails to meet the high supply of memory and flash chips. The oversupply has led to , for both DRAM and NAND flash chips in the past several quarters, and the prices are still expected to decline significantly this year in both markets.,Due to the excessive supply, Micron saw a drop of over 20 percent in its product average selling price (ASP) during the previous quarter that ended on February 28, 2019. DRAM and NAND pricing falling lower than expected also led to a decline in revenues of 26 percent sequentially and 21 percent year-over-year to US$5.8 billion for Q2.  ,Micron’s DRAM ASP fell 21-23 percent quarter-on-quarter, while DRAM revenues decreased 30 percent on quarter and 28 percent compared to a year before. Its NAND flash revenues dropped 18 percent on quarter and 2 percent year-over-year. NAND flash ASPs declined 25 percent compared to the previous quarter, but bit shipments increased by ""a high single-digit percentage,"" according to DigiTimes. ,Micron expects its revenues to fall another 17 percent in Q3 to $4.6-5 billion, with gross margin dropping to 37-40 percent from 50 percent in the prior quarter.,Mehrotra noted that despite the challenging market, Micron has continued to execute well, and he believes it will emerge stronger once the market improves."
"Intel Optane AMA Reader's Recap, Storage, Caching and Memory Explained","Earlier this week the Tom’s Hardware Community Team held , about their Optane products and 3D XPoint technology in general. We ended up getting a number of excellent questions on the subject, so we wanted to post a recap of the AMA for our readers who aren't always active in the forums. Thanks again to both the Intel team for taking the time to answer reader questions, as well as the AT Forums community team for organizing this.,Before diving in, be sure to ,. Our giveaway runs until April 5th. Please see , for a full list of rules and ways to enter.,Chris Tobias, Director, Intel Optane Team ,James Myers, Director, Data Center Storage Solutions Architecture,Roger Corell, Marketing Manager,Avinash Shetty, Senior SSD Strategic Planner and Product Line Manager,Mark Henderson, Storage Technology Marketing Engineer,A: Intel Optane memory is a unique technology that bridges a gap between ‘memory’ and ‘storage.’ Like RAM it sits within the PC memory hierarchy. By placing commonly used data and programs closer to the processor, Intel Optane memory allows the systems to access this information more quickly and improve overall system responsiveness. Intel Optane memory cannot replace DRAM entirely. However, these two memory technologies complement each other within the PC.,Intel does provide a recommended fact tag guidance for its products. For example, for Intel Optane memory, we recommend calling out the entire capacity and the memory technology in the memory line. ,Memory : 20GB Memory : 16GB Intel Optane Memory + 4GB DDR4 DRAM or,Memory : 16GB Intel Optane Memory + 4GB DDR4 DRAM or,Intel Optane memory and DRAM are called out separately without total.,Fact tag positioning is the retailer’s decision. Guidance provided as-is; with no warranties or indemnities, express or implied.,Q: Will full Optane functionality ever be supported on non Intel platforms? Like AMD Ryzen and future ARM Snapdragon Windows 10 machines?,A: Intel Optane SSDs conform to the PCIe and NVMe specifications. The Intel Optane memory client solution is only supported on Intel processors.,A: The cool, smart people we all get to work with--and the opportunity to drive change in the computing industry. The platform architecture has been around for decades and it's finally shifting, as we blur the lines between memory and storage! Plus, we get to wear cool Optane swag! #OptaneBowtie,A: Thank you for understanding that Optane is a workload benefit product. To further answer your question, just take a look at what Tom's Hardware said about ,. To quote from the article: ,"" . . .It's worth the price because it is the fastest SSD on the market. It doesn't matter if you primarily play games or render nuclear simulations for the Pentagon: this is the uncontested performance champion."",Thank you for championing Intel Optane technology! Keep rocking your Optane with pride!,A: We don't see DRAM going away completely at this point, but we're open to new ideas. To see what we've done on the data center side of things, head over to , and use it as a development platform to see what you can do. If you want to try Intel Optane to see what it can do to extend memory in virtualization or MySQL, ,. And we continue to innovate on the client."
Seagate Announces LaCie Rugged RAID Shuttle and 2big RAID External Drive Enclosures,"LaCie, Seagate Technology’s premium brand, has announced two new external storage products for desktop use and a rugged portable in the LaCie 2big RAID and LaCie Rugged RAID Shuttle. Both products offer an internal RAID 0/1 setup for increased speed or redundancy and USB-C USB 3.1 (Thunderbolt 3 and USB 3.0 compatible) interface for faster transfer speeds. The 2big RAID is intended to be a more static fixture while the Rugged RAID Shuttle, as the name implies, is designed for the rigors of travel and its inherent abuse.,The Lacie , offers the same features as the Rugged RAID Pro such as speeds up to 250 MB/s using Hardware-based RAID (0/1 supported as well as JBOD), IP54 dust and water resistance, as well as being 1.2 meter drop and shock resistant. The main differences between the Pro and Shuttle is the latter uses Seagate Secure Hardware Encryption on the drive, double the capacity (up to 8 TB, two 2.5-inch drives) and is slightly larger in size. The Shuttle does not have the include an SD card reader.,The Seagate Secure Hardware Encryption uses AES 256-bit encryption methods and is said to be transparent to the user – in other words, no performance overhead. It can be password enabled or used as normal. The chassis is a secure design Seagate says is hard to crack and open. The unit has an orange rubber surround on it to assist with that drop and shock resistance as well as being able to withstand a crushing force of a two-ton car rolling over it.,The unit is connected to the system through a USB 3.1 Gen 1 Type-C interface and is also compatible with USB 3.0 Type-A with an included adapter cable. The device is powered through the USB port and in most cases, even when using two 4 TB drives, power is fine. However, if the device is used with an older generation PC or small compact devices, you will need to use the optional external brick (included).,The Rugged RAID Shuttle offers a three-year warranty and Rescue Services as well as a 1-Month Adobe Creative Cloud All Apps.,The ,, on the other hand, is designed to be an external desktop solution without the rugged capabilities of the Rugged RAID Shuttle. This device supports speeds of up to 440 MB/s (RAID 0), supports RAID 0 and 1 as well as JBOD - all of which is configured through LaCie Toolkit software. For increased reliability, IronWolf Pro Enterprise-class HDDs are used. ,The 2big RAID is suggested to be used for video editing, back up, and archiving and will support capacities up to 16 TB using full-size 3.5-inch drives. Compared to the 2big Thunderbolt 2, it adds USB 3.1 Gen 2 connectivity, compatibility with Thunderbolt 3 hosts without using an adapter, and preformatted exFAT drives.,The chassis is an aluminum unibody enclosure capable of fitting two 3.5-inch HDDs and is powered by an external power supply. The 5-year warranty also includes five years of Rescue Data Recovery Services.,The 8TB LaCie Rugged RAID Shuttle will be available in May 2019 with an MSRP of $529.99. The LaCie 2big RAID is available starting April 2019 with an MSRP of $419, $529, and $739 for the 4 TB, 8 TB, and 16 TB models respectively."
Community Questions: Do You Use Intel Optane?,"Now that you all had the chance to , regarding Intel Optane, we wanted to know your thoughts. Do you use Intel Optane products or intend to add these storage devices to your system in the near future?,In full disclosure, I am not an Optane user. When building my latest rig, I did consider it. There was a lot of back-and-forth about the subject between the moderators and myself, but in the end I decided not to. The main use case would be to improve game load times. I have a pretty large library of Steam games, and an extensive collection of classic game backups I play with an emulator. All in all my game library tallies up to roughly 4TB in size. While this isn't the largest games library, it's still fairly large. Getting a single SSD with enough storage space to fit 4TB of games is not exactly cheap.,While , prices have gone down, and ,, at the time of writing a single 4TB SSD still costs over $500. I simply didn't have room in my budget for such a purchase. And so, I did consider opting for Optane when assembling my components list. I thought that I would get the best of both worlds with Intel Optane: lots of storage space and a speedy cache drive to load all my games. Even then, I just couldn't make the pricing work. The latest and greatest usually has a requisite expensive price, and Intel Optane is no different. The , costs roughly $175 for 118GB, while a 512GB , can be purchased for around $160. The pricing for true Optane caching just didn't work in comparison. That's not to say I'm not a fan of Intel Optane technology. I just couldn't find the right use case scenario for my needs and my budget.,And with that, I turn to you dear readers for all of your hot takes. What do you think of the Intel Optane product line? Do have any Optane products in your system at the moment? Do you plans to use Optane in your next build? We know there are tons of use case scenarios for Intel Optane, so workstation and server builders, please chime in as well!,Don't forget! We're running a , for the Intel Optane SSD 905p 960GB.

Trendfocus: HDD Shipments Fell to 77 Million in 1Q19,"The way we store information often changes. We started out drawing on cave walls, then etched words into stone tablets, and then found countless things we could stain with ink. Digital storage mechanisms are no different, which is why a Trendfocus report saying HDD shipments fell nearly 13 percent in the first quarter of 2019 isn't particularly shocking, although the decline can't only be attributed to waning interest in hard drives.,Storage Newsletter , the ""SDAS: HDD Information Service, Preliminary CQ1 ’18 Quarterly Update"" Trendfocus published on April 9. (Trendfocus offers precious little information to the public; its most recent blog post is from December 2017.) That report is said to have described falling shipments in the global desktop and laptop HDD markets both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. Enterprise sales rebounded, though.,Desktop HDD shipments are said to have fallen to just 24.5 million units, a drop of nearly 4 million units from the previous quarter. Laptop HDD shipments dropped more than 6 million units to hit the 37 million mark. Enterprise HDDs are said to have rebounded by nearly 1 million units, however, to around 11.5 million hard drives purchased in the quarter. Business customers essentially picked up the slack left by consumers.,These shipments were likely affected by many factors. Seasonal buying patterns can help account for the decline in the laptop HDD market, for example, and the desktop market was likely affected by the ongoing shortage of Intel processors. Manufacturers are making fewer systems, which means they need fewer hard drives to put in those systems. That might change if the shortage ends or consumers buy more pre-built systems.,But there's also the simple fact that most people want SSDs instead of HDDs for most of their devices. Nobody wants to wait for their system to boot, their files to load, or their apps to finish routine tasks. As SSDs become more affordable--especially high-capacity offerings that rival consumer HDDs--they can slowly replace hard drives in more aspects of computing. The spinning discs will go from must-haves to must-avoids."
"Longsys to Launch First Fully China-Produced SSDs, up to 4TB","The popular saying that ""today's wars are won with chips"" applies to both traditional and economic warfare, and China's reliance on western technology is a strategic weakness that has the country embarking on multi-year initiatives to reduce its reliance on foreign chips.,To that effect, China instituted a plan to develop its own home-grown chips, providing incentives and other measures to indigenous manufacturers. Some of those measures have come to fruition through partnerships with U.S. companies, like ,, and the slow but steadily-increasing number of foreign-owned silicon fabs popping up in China. In either case, China's memory imports, which include the flash memory used in SSDs, have increased 40% since 2016, meaning this segment of the market continues to be a vexing issue for those in China's halls of power.,But what does all of this have to do with SSDs? Well, all the compute power in the world is worthless if you can't store the data, and SSDs are unequivocally the path forward for storage. That makes the recent Longsys announcement that it has developed a 100% China-produced SSD all the more interesting.,SSD performance largely hinges on the SSD controller, a microchip that orchestrates all of the various components, but these small processors are amazingly complex. They also tend to come from Western suppliers. To circumvent that issue, Longsys tapped China-based Yeetor Microelectronics and Maxio Technology's new GK2302 SSD controller design for its new SSDs. These controllers support capacities up to 4TB and come with a few key requirements for the Chinese market: Much like the AMD spin-off processors built by Hygon, these SSDs come with Chinese government-approved encryption and decryption mechanisms to keep out prying Western eyes. ,With a China-indigenous SSD controller in hand, the company turned to China-native Yangtze Memory Technologies (YMTC), a subsidiary of the ,, for the actual NAND flash. YMTC has its new 64-layer Xtacking 3D flash coming to market in 2019, which meshes well with Longsys's announcement that the fully China-made SSDs will come to market this year. YMTC also plans to move forward to 128-layer flash in 2020, which we expect will make an appearance in Longsys's future generations of SSDs.,Technical ,, but we do know that the Longys's as-yet-unnamed SSDs will come with the SATA 6 Gb/s interface and the company claims it will deliver up to 500 MB/s of throughput. That's standard for today's SSDs that saturate the SATA interface. The company claims the SSD controllers are 15% faster than their predecessors and have 6.5% lower power consumption. The company hasn't shared other fine-grained specifications, like random read and write performance. It also didn't share information about a DRAM supplier, likely meaning these are DRAM-less SSDs.,It isn't clear if these China-produced SSDs will ever come to the U.S. market, though it does seem unlikely. Given China's preferential treatment of indigenous manufacturers, these SSDs will likely be confined to the China market. , and Lexar products (,) in the U.S., including USB flash drives, SSDs, memory cards, and embedded memory products."
Unannounced Samsung 2TB 970 Pro SSD Listed at Retail (Updated)," Samsung sent a statement and confirmed it has not released the 2TB version of the 970 Pro NVMe M.2 SSD we saw teased on the German and Chinese websites below. While this doesn't necessarily mean we will never see one, remember 2TB Samsung drives can already be found on the market in the 960 Pro and unreleased 2TB 970 EVO Plus (albeit with different NAND), we now know with certainty the 2TB 970 Pro is not planned. ,About a year ago, Samsung unveiled its latest and greatest M.2 SSD in the form of the 970 Pro, which ,. The 970 is one of the fastest consumer M.2 NVMe SSDs on the market and arrived in capacities up to 1 TB. This was a bit odd considering the previous-gen 960 Pro came out of the gate with a 2TB option. Fast forward to today, and German and Chinese retailers have listed a 2TB 970 Pro SKU (MZ-V7P2T0BW) that purportedly fills the lineup out. ,We do not know when or if Samsung will officially announce the SSD or provide information on availability. Details on the internals are scarce, but the drive is rumored to use Samsung's 64-layer 2-bit MLC V-NAND, 2GB LPDDR4, and the Samsung Phoenix controller found in the lower capacity models. Speeds should be as fast or faster than the 1TB model which comes in at 3,500/2,700 MB/s read/write and 500K/500K IOPS (max - on 1TB models) read/write.,The price of the vaporware SSD shows 8,888¥ (~$80) on one site, but obviously, even with SSD prices coming down, a 2TB device won’t be close to sub-$100. The 970 Pro 1TB can be found for , so we expect this flagship to fetch a lot more when (and if) it comes out with double the capacity. "
"Intel Optane Memory H10 SSDs Coming to OEM Laptops Soon, Desktops Later","Intel announced today that its new Optane Memory H10 SSDs are coming to OEM laptops beginning in the second quarter of 2019, with support for the do-it-yourself market coming in the future. The company also released the first full specifications of the drives. These new SSDs marry Optane memory with QLC flash on a single M.2 stick to fuse the speed of Optane with the capacity and low pricing of QLC flash.,Intel's Optane Memory, which is based upon the fast 3D XPoint memory, provides the ultimate in storage performance, but high pricing has long hindered its broader adoption. Intel's Optane SSD 800p is currently the most capacious Optane M.2 drive, but it tops out at a mere 118GB. That's too small for most users searching for an all-in-one solution. ,In a bid to improve pricing and capacity, Intel created the new M.2 H10 SSDs in three variants. As we can see above, the SSD has two different packages for data storage (Optane to the far right and QLC in the center), along with two SSD controllers (one for each type of storage).,The H10 drives present themselves to the operating system as two separate PCIe 3.0 x2 SSDs, and they only work with motherboards that support PCIe bifurcation. The two drives are then combined using Intel's Rapid Storage Technology (RST) software that stores frequently-accessed data on the faster Optane Memory, thus boosting performance in everyday tasks. The software places less-used data on the slower QLC flash, which provides additional capacity. Because this cache is transparent to the user, the drives expose 256GB, 512GB, or 1TB of usable storage to the user even though they actually have more storage capacity onboard.,Intel recently enabled Optane support for the H10 SSDs and Optane Memory caching, including for the cheap Pentium and Celeron chips, via a new ,. Support for these lower-end chips does come with a few caveats, though, as you'll need an 8th-gen (or higher) processor and RST driver 17.2, or later. We covered the finer details in a recent article, so ,.,The NVMe H10 drives come in a single-sided form factor, meaning all the components reside on one side of the PCB, which is a good fit for today's thin-and-light devices. The drives also support the L1.2 low power states, which allow the drive to sip only 15mW when they are idle. Intel also backs the drives with a five-year warranty.,Each of the two storage devices come with a PCIe 3.0 x2 connection but still offer up to 2,400/1,800 MB/s of sequential read/write throughput paired with up to 32,000/30,000 random read/write IOPS at a queue depth of 1. These metrics aren't as impressive as some of the specifications we see with leading SSDs that jump into the range of 400,000 IOPS, but that's because Intel measures performance where it matters - under light load conditions (QD1 and QD2), while SSD vendors tend to list performance with completely unrealistic loadings (QD265) that you would never see in a consumer-class application. ,The Optane H10 consists of two SSDs (an Intel 600p and 905p), each with its own PCIe 3.0 x2 link, but you might notice that the 2,400 MB/s of peak throughput is higher than the bandwidth of the PCIe 3.0 x2 link (~1,970 MB/s). That's because, under certain conditions, Intel's RST software can read and write from both SSDs simultaneously using a bandwidth aggregation technique.,While the H10 isn't geared for the ultimate in performance, that's still the purview of its pure-Optane drives, the company claims it boosts real-world performance in most tasks we expect with laptops, like normal light operating system usage and office productivity, content creation, and mainstream gaming. These drives aren't well-suited for heavier users, like professionals that transcode video, but they do carry a sufficient 300TBW endurance rating for normal desktop PC use, meaning you can write 300TB to the drive over its warranty period. ,The key here is to accelerate the real-world multi-tasking workloads that tend to be rather light in nature, which is a natural fit for Intel's speedy Optane memory. Intel claims the drives will launch documents up to two times faster, boost game launches by 60%, and open large multimedia files up to 90% faster during multi-tasking. We'll be testing these drives soon to verify those performance claims.,Intel isn't selling the drives separately yet, so we weren't provided with pricing specifics, though the company does plan to add support for certain motherboards in the future. For now, the drives will find their way into laptops from a range of Best Buy OEMs, including Dell, HPI, ASUS, with other OEMs and retailers coming soon. Intel will also bring support for the drives to its NUC lineup soon. We can expect to see laptops with the new drives arrive in the second quarter of 2019. ,Image Credits:"
PC Hard Drive Sales Could Nearly Halve This Year,"We can't think of anyone who'd rather have a hard drive in their system than a solid state drive in 2019. It turns out that many PC manufacturers have realized this, with Nidec , would drop nearly 50 percent this year as companies embrace SSDs in their products.,Tom's Hardware (step) sister site AnandTech , in the company's most recent earnings report. The company makes spindle motors used by HDDs, and with its claim that its products can be found in roughly 85% of hard drives, it's in a pretty good position to predict where the storage market could be heading. So, its claim that PC HDD sales will drop 48% over the course of 2019 is worth paying attention to.,Note that the company doesn't think all HDD sales will fall by half over the next year. Nidec is specifically referring to hard drives used as internal storage--sales of HDDs used in data centers or for external storage are expected to remain stable. That makes sense. Data centers are expected to store massive amounts of information, and most people don't expect their external storage to be as fast as their internal drives, so HDDs suit those markets.,But dwindling costs of SSDs combined with rising capacities ,of HDDs as primary storage. Manufacturers can now improve their products in noticeable ways--even the least technically inclined can usually feel the difference between an SSD and HDD--without having to increase prices dramatically. That's made SSDs more popular than ever in pre-built desktop systems and, more important, broad swaths of the notebook market.,Nidec's prediction lines up with a Trendfocus , which indicated that desktop HDD shipments fell by 4 million, laptop HDD shipments fell by 6 million, and enterprise HDD shipments rose by 1 million in the first quarter of 2019. Nidec offered different numbers--it said it expects sales of PC hard drives to fall from 124 million units to 65 million units this year--but either way, PC hard drive sales are expected to fall.,The manufacturer expects to survive this decline by shifting its focus away from HDDs and towards automobiles and home appliances. Other companies will either have to rely on the external storage market, appeal to enterprise customers, or simply accept that every disk stops spinning eventually so they can refocus on other storage formats. That might not be great news for them, but it aligns with our common demand for ever-faster devices."
Check out this awesome UK deal on Samsung’s 970 Pro 512GB M.2 SSD,"Once upon a time, all SSDs were expensive. Then it was just high performance models. Today? You can get one of the finest NAND-based SSDs around, the Samsung 970 Pro 512GB M.2, for well under £150. That’s an incredible deal compared to when it first launched., , ,OK, £140 for the Samsung 970 Pro in 512GB spec isn’t exactly pocket change. But around a year ago when the 970 Pro was launched, it was listed at £249 and typically sold for about £220. That’s a big saving and one hell of a deal on what remains one , on the market and the cheapest yet that we’ve seen. Samsung’s dominance in the realm of NAND flash has been well documented over the years, with the performance usually following the premium, so seeing the 970 Pro at such a low price, only fills us with joy.,Highlights include the M.2 form factor and with it, a quad-lane PCI Express interface for maximum SSD throughput. Net result? Multiple gigabytes of sequential performance for both reads and writes. It wasn’t all that long ago that the Samsung 970 Pro 512GB’s 3.5GB/s read and 2.3GB/s write performance was the stuff of system memory rather than a hard disk. Impressive. ,Of course, although sequential speeds do make for some ,, arguably the more important real-world daily PC performance metric is the short-queue random access figure. Thanks to its advanced Phoenix controller chipset, the Samsung 970 Pro is about as good as flash-based SSDs get there, too. Plus, it’s all backed up by a write endurance rating of 600TB and a five-year warranty. So, spending a little extra on this deal should make for a sound long-term investment.,Of course you can find SSDs that certainly come cheaper than the Samsung 970 Pro. But few come faster. At least they don’t when is comes to NAND flash drives. Admittedly, , Optane drives are much faster still by some metrics. But they’re also megabucks.,At £140 for a 512GB model, you’re getting a crazy quick flash drive that’s big enough for a proper operating system install, plus a lot of apps, including your favourite games. If you’re looking for a long term investment rather than a budget drive to tide you over, the Samsung 970 Pro at this all-time low price comes highly recommended."
Zombie Loading: Intel Patches Slow Down SSDs as AMD Gains Ground,"From Spectre / Meltdown last year to , most recently, Intel CPUs have had more than their fair share of security vulnerabilities. Unfortunately, fixing these security holes comes at a cost as, with each patch, Intel and its partners shut down an avenue of attack by eliminating processes that had allowed for faster performance. ,Unfortunately, as our tests show below, the mitigations have had a huge impact on storage speeds on systems with Intel processors, affecting the times it takes your SSD to do everything from loading games to copying files. In test after test, we saw Intel's storage performance dive several percentage points after last year's Spectre / Meltdown patches and then lose a few points more with the new Zombieload fixes. Where AMD, which hasn't suffered from all of these vulnerabilities, trailed Intel in storage performance before patches, it has now caught up or even moved ahead on many workloads.,To find out just how much the patches affect storage performance and how team blue stacks up to team red in storage performance, we ran some tests with two desktops: one powered by an Intel Core i7-9700K and the other by an AMD Ryzen 7 2700X.,It's noteworthy that the Core i7-9700K we used for testing isn't a Hyper-Threaded processor. Intel advises that customers in riskier environments should disable Hyper-Threading to ensure 100% protection from the latest vulnerabilities, so the performance impact can be higher than outlined here. Intel's 9700K also has in-silicon mitigations that help reduce the impact of some previous vulnerabilities, so be aware that older processors will lose more performance that outlined below. ,, but do lose a minimal amount of performance from the existing Spectre patches.,We recently conducted a fresh round of testing with all of the latest Spectre and Meltdown patches for another article, but just days after, Intel announced the latest Microarchitectural Data Sampling (MDS) vulnerabilities, more broadly called Zombieload, RIDL, and Fallout.,We have two sets of data for comparison today. One test configuration consists of Windows 10 64-bit, OS Build 17763.504 with Meltdown and Spectre patches disabled via the InSpectre application on the Intel system, representing a ""clean"" unpatched system. We also tested with all Meltdown, Spectre, and MDS mitigations enabled with that same Windows build on both systems.,We included our original testing on the Intel system with with Windows OS Build 17763.475 and the Spectre and Meltdown patches enabled, but without the MDS patches. This will allow us to see the impact of the latest round of mitigations compared to the previous patches.,We know that the patches aren't going to make a significant impact on frames per second (FPS) during gaming, but we're concerned about slower game loading times. Game loading is dependent upon the speed of the underlying storage system, hence why SSDs load game levels so quickly, but the reduced storage performance borne of the patches should have some impact.,The , benchmark is a free real-world game benchmark that easily and accurately compares game load times without the inaccuracy of using a stopwatch, so it's perfect for this task.,In our game load test, there is a 6.2% reduction in Intel's performance with the Meltdown/Spectre patches enabled, and about a 1% additional loss when we add the MDS patches to the mix. That's bad news for Intel because now the AMD system takes a 4% lead.,Flinging around files on your PC is a pretty common task, and the ability to move and create files quickly also gives us a decent idea of performance with other types of workloads, like compressing and decompressing files. We use the DiskBench storage benchmarking tool to test file transfer performance with our own custom 50GB block of data. Our data set includes 31,227 files of various types, like pictures, PDFs, and videos. We copy the files to a new folder and then follow up with a read test of a newly-written 6 GB file.,DiskBench reveals an 8.2% loss in Intel's file copy performance and a 1.4% loss in sequential read performance by having the Meltdown/Spectre patches enabled. Adding in the MDS mitigations showed an additional 2.5% impact on copy performance and 0.5% impact on read performance.,Compared to our AMD system, we see that Intel still offers about 1.5% faster file copies, but it loses by 6.3% during the file reading test.,PCMark 8 is a trace-based benchmark that uses Microsoft Office, Adobe Creative Suite, ,, and, to measure the performance of storage devices in real-world scenarios. This jack-of-all-trades test gives us a good gauge of overall performance in common PC tasks.,In PCMark 8, the total score didn’t change much by enabling and disabling the patches, but the average bandwidth sure did. With slower random and sequential performance, Intel's average bandwidth decreased 2%. The AMD system scored just 0.2% lower than Intel in this test, and its bandwidth was about 14% lower as well. Even with the Ryzen 2700X's extra threads and faster performance in synthetic storage tests (which we'll see below), the Intel system's higher frequency allowed it to outperform the AMD system.,Like PCMark, SYSmark uses real applications to measure system performance. SYSmark takes things much further, though. The software uses fourteen different applications that run real workloads with real data sets to measure how overall system performance impacts the user experience. BAPCo's SYSmark 2014 SE installs a full suite of applications for its tests, which includes Microsoft Office, Google Chrome, Corel WinZip, several Adobe software applications, and GIMP. That also makes it a great test to measure the amount of time it takes to install widely-used programs after you install a fresh operating system.,In SYSmark 2018, Intel drops 2.6% in the overall performance score after we enable the patches. But even more telling, Intel loses nearly 6% in the system responsiveness metric, which measures snappiness. This stems directly from sensitivity to storage changes more than the other aspects of the test. These aren't huge changes overall, but it gives AMD a 1% lead in the overall score and a 2% lead in responsiveness.,Now we'll turn to synthetic tests to see just how the patches resulted in the lower performance in the real-world workloads above. CrystalDiskMark (CDM) is a simple file size benchmarking tool that offers plenty of measurements for comparison.,Sequential performance at a queue depth (QD) of 32, which represents a very heavy load you won't see often on a PC, shows no difference in performance with the Meltdown/Spectre patches toggled on and off. But Intel lost 14% of its performance when we tested at a more realistic QD of 1. This means that transfers of a single file will see a significant slowdown. Looking at how the new MDS patches have impacted performance over the previous implementations, we see another ~1% reduction in performance.,Unfortunately, 4K random performance is impacted the most. This is, by far, the most common type of file access inside an operating system, like Windows, so it is a disappointing sign. At a high QD of 64, we see an 18% loss in read performance and a 12% loss in write performance, but this heavy load isn't common for a PC. Most PC workloads fall in the QD1-2 range, and workstation users can hit upwards of QD8. When testing at these lower QDs, we see a staggering 41% reduction in read and write performance from enabling the Meltdown/Spectre patches. Adding in the new MDS fixes, we can see an additional 2.5% to 6% performance loss.,When compared to the AMD system, we see that the difference in sequential performance is also negligible at a high QD of 32, but at QD1, AMD is actually 10.7% - 12.4% faster than the Intel system. That lead widens when we compare 4K random performance. At QD64, the AMD system dished out 26% more read performance and 30% higher write performance. Just as we observed during high-QD workloads, the AMD system outperformed the Intel system in light workloads (low QDs). The AMD system provides 33-35% more performance than the Intel test mule. Scaling the workload up to QD2-QD8 reveals a 15-20% lead for AMD in reads and writes, too.,Intel, and the chipmaking industry at large, have their hands full lately. Not only are new vulnerabilities appearing from left and right, but the patches often equate to big losses in performance. AMD hasn't been as exposed to these vulnerabilities, and as a result, the red team has caught up to Intel quite a bit and even taken the lead in some areas.,In synthetic testing, the performance impact can be huge--upwards of a 41% reduction in 4K random metrics. But the performance drop in real-world applications isn't quite as frightful. Our application testing measured a ~1-10% reduction in performance, depending on the test. While the difference isn’t huge, now we are faced with performance losses due to these patches if we want to keep our data safe.,If you have an Intel CPU with Hyper-Threading, things can get worse. Disabling Hyper-Threading is the only way to be fully protected from the MDS vulnerabilities, leading Google to disable Hyper-Threading on its Chrome OS 74 (and later). If you have a processor with Hyper-Threading, that can cost you up to 40% of your performance in applications. The price for full protection in some cases comes at the cost of a feature that users have already paid for: To assure 100% protection from the latest vulnerabilities, you essentially have to transform your expensive 8C/16T Core i9-9900K into an 8C/8T Core i7-9700K.,Even worse for Intel, AMD has caught up in storage performance, and even surpassed Intel in some instances, due to the latest patches. AMD’s Simultaneous Multi-Threading (SMT), which is similar to Intel's Hyper-Threading., also isn’t affected by the latest wave of attacks. That could open up an even larger gap in application performance and change the value comparison in the hotly-contested mid-range price bands.,Intel is working mitigations into silicon for next-gen CPUs as we speak, but how many more vulnerabilities will there be, and will the industry be able to fully catch up? How much slower could systems get over the coming months due to new mitigations? The answers to these questions are unknown, but things are sure looking good for AMD right now."
DRAMeXchange: SSD Prices to Fall Below 10 Cents Per GB,"The hard drive is going gently into that good night, and it might do it faster than anyone expected because DRAMeXchange , that it expects the price-per-gigabyte of 512GB and 1TB SSDs to fall below 10 cents for the first time by the end of this year.,This decline was attributed to ""weakened stocking momentum due to the cautious stance of PC, smartphones and servers/datacenters OEMs towards end market sales and high inventory levels, leading to an overly oversupplied NAND flash market; price wars by leading SSD suppliers who are keen to get their 64/72-layer stocks off their hands; and the price comparison effect as a result of Intel 3D QLC SSDs."",DRAMeXchange said the lower prices should lead 128GB SSDs to be replaced by their 512GB counterparts as the new standard. Because the price drop is expected to extend to 1TB SSDs, those products should be able to reach a much larger portion of the market. By now most people know that SSDs are faster than HDDs, and with prices falling while capacities rise, there's ,.,The confluence of these changes is leading to shifts in pretty much every part of the market. DRAMeXchange said that SSDs are now in more than half of laptops, and it expects PCIe SSDs to reach a similar portion of the market, thanks to relative pricing parity between them and their SATA counterparts. These shifts can lead to improved performance in everything from low-end laptops to high-end builds.,It's no wonder HDD sales are expected to fall this year. A part supplier called Nidec said earlier this month that , by as much as 48% in 2019 as consumers and manufacturers alike shift to SSDs. Hard drives will still have their niche--mostly among enterprise users and people who need external storage--, but we suspect that eventually, they'll start to be replaced in those markets too.,There is some good news for storage companies: DRAMeXchange expected demand to pick up because of ""the traditional peak season and increased stocking demand from the new Apple devices."" That should allow SSD makers to slow down the decline in their prices, but continued drops are seemingly inevitable. Welcome to the new normal--it should load much faster than the old one. Hallelujah."
Plugable Releases USB-C Enclosure for NVMe SSDs,"Not everyone wants to crack open , to install NVMe storage--especially if they want to use the same drive across multiple devices. That's what , are for, but they can sometimes be a hassle to transport. The new Plugable USB-C NVMe Enclosure announced today is supposed to address both problems for people who want it all.,The enclosure features a tool-free, spring-loaded design for simplifying the drive insertion and removal process. All one has to do is open the enclosure, pop in an NVMe drive and then plug the enclosure into whatever system they like via USB 3.1 Gen 2. Mercifully, the company includes both USB-C and USB-C to USB-A cables. (The struggle to keep up with ever-changing ports and cables is real.),The enclosure's speed depends on the inserted drive, but Plugable said it supports up to 10 Gb/s transfers, which should be more than quick enough for most people's needs. ,Plugable didn't offer specific details about heat though. All it said is that the enclosure offers ""advanced thermal management"" thanks to an ""aluminum body"" that ""allows for peak heat dissipation compared to other solutions available on the market."",You may not need something like the Plugable USB-C NVMe Enclosure. External SSDs are smaller than ever, and for those who need something even smaller, an SD card might do. A lot of the data with which we interact every day is also synced via the cloud, so some consumers may see little reason to buy an NVMe SSD and the accompanying enclosure. Business users, however, might appreciate the ability to easily transport sensitive information in a small, but still manageable, device.,Besides, part of the reason so many people have entrusted the cloud with their information is that transporting it used to be such a hassle. Drives were big, didn't hold a lot of data and were about as quick as a geriatric turtle. Enclosures like this could help solve all those problems and, perhaps, lead more people to manage their data themselves, rather than letting tech companies do so. At least the option will be available.,And, hey, at this point it makes more sense to get an external NVMe SSD than it does to get a hard drive. It's 2019: ,. We're all about SSDs now, folks, no matter what form they take. SATA? Sure. NVMe? You bet. Internal? External? Eh, there's little difference. As long as storage is quick and easy to transport (if desired) then it's good enough for most people.,The Plugable USB-C NVMe Enclosure is available now on , for $50. We're told that price includes a $10 launch discount, so don't be surprised if the price jumps to $60 before long. Remember, the drive is sold separately--this isn't an NVMe ,giveaway in disguise."
NAND Flash Vendors Struggled in Late 2018 - Research,"DRAMeXchange, a division of the market research firm TrendForce, shared research today saying rising economic uncertainties have caused NAND flash customers to delay or cancel their recent orders. This situation led to revenue loss for NAND flash vendor Samsung and vendors overall seeing a 16.9 percent quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) revenue decline in Q4 2018. ,As we’ve seen with the recent decline in DRAM orders, customers are starting to delay their restocking or may even cancel orders if they can’t afford them, due to their current financial situations or because they expected the prices to fall even further in the near future. DRAMeXchanges noted that NAND flash suppliers also suffered because Apple saw lower than expected sales in the new quarter as the customers’ desire to switch from previous iPhones to newer more expensive models declined. Laptops demand also fell primarily due to, and OEMs’ inability to switch to more available AMD chip alternatives in due time.,Despite flash vendors overall revenue decline, bit shipments saw a 40 percent increase for the whole of 2018. For the entire year revenue was also up, hitting a record high of $63.2 billion, a 10.9 percent increase from 2017.,Still, DRAMeXchange expects the ""demand slump"" to continue in Q1 2019. ,Samsung’s bit shipments for Q4 2018 fell by more than 7 percent QoQ as weak demand across the smartphone, server and , markets hit the company, while its revenue declined by 28.9 percent QoQ, down to $4.3 billion.,According to DRAMeXchange, Samsung intends to maintain its current production capacity for 3D NAND flash for 2019 but will shrink production for 2D NAND flash as products based on it start to become less popular.,SK Hynix saw 10 percent growth in bit shipments in Q4 2018, but the company still fell short of expectations as smartphones saw weak demand in the same time period. SK Hynix lost 13.4 percent revenue QoQ, down to $1.59 billion.,The vendor intends to ramp up NAND flash production this year at the newly built M15 factory. It will mostly continue to sell 72-layer NAND flash storage this year but will also begin the mass production of 96-layer flash products.,Toshiba was also impacted by weak iPhone demand, as well as the Intel , shortage, but its NAND flash bit shipments remained steady QoQ. However, the company also saw a decline of 14.7 percent in revenue (down to $2.73 billion) compared to the previous quarter.,At Western Digital’s, request Toshiba will lower production this year. It will primarily manufacture 64-layer NAND flash chips.,DRAMeXchange noted that the , negatively impacted Western Digital. Despite a 5 percent growth in bit shipments QoQ, the company still saw a revenue loss of 14.2 percent (down to $2.17 billion).,Western Digital is expected to lower its production by 10-15 percent this year. The company is currently negotiating joint investment in Toshiba's latest factory in Iwate Prefecture, Japan.,Micron had a better quarter than most, primarily due to its strong enterprise , sales, as well as increased shipments of UFS (universal flash storage) and uMCP (UFS-based multi-chip package) products. However, due to market pressure to lower prices, the company also saw a revenue loss of 2.2 percent QoQ, down to $2.18 billion.,In 2019, Micron will focus on switching more of its product lineups to 96-layer technology, so its bit shipments growth should be closer to the industry average.,As the leader in server SSDs, Intel was the only vendor to see a revenue growth of 2.4 percent, reaching $1.12 billion in sales. Like everyone else, Intel’s unit prices also fell 10-20 percent in Q4 2018.,Most of Intel’s NAND flash products are manufactured with 64-layer technology, and this will remain unchanged in 2019. However, the company is expected to switch 30 percent of its production to 96-layers this year."
EK Water Blocks Releases Passive Heatsink for Intel Optane 905P M.2 SSD,"EK Water Blocks , for the M.2 version of the Intel Optane 905P NVMe SSD. The company said it co-developed the product (presumably with Intel) to ensure top performance free of thermal throttling.,The heatsink was granted the unimaginative moniker of EK-M.2 Intel Optane Heatsink--along with all the appropriate copyright marks and trademark notices--and is compatible with M.2 Optane SSDs with a 110mm length (22110).,EKWB said the heatsink's performance ""is achieved via thermal pads that transfer heat to the aluminum heatsink that is finned for a larger dissipation area."" The design is also supposed to let it be ""easy to install"" and ""aesthetically not intrusive."",The result? According to EKWB, consistent performance combined with a longer lifespan. (We haven't tested these claims ourselves, of course, so we make no guarantees about the heatsink's utility.),This was all easier said than done. EKWB said the Optane 905P's 9.35W power draw necessitated the use of a dedicated cooler like the one it just released. Otherwise the drive could suffer from regular heat-induced throttling or, potentially, failures.,EKWB was careful to note that the EK-M.2 Intel Optane Heatsink should only be used with motherboards that explicitly say they're compatible with 22110 M.2 SSDs. The heatsink is available now via , and Partner Reseller Network with a $20 MSRP."
Prices for 1TB Gaming SSDs Slashed in Half This Year- Report,"Good news, gamers: SSD prices are reportedly falling. According to a, today, unit prices for 1TB ,have fallen more than 50 percent since 2018. Which at time of writing means the prices fell more than one percent a day since the start of the New Year. That should make it easier than ever to hoard as many digital titles as you'd like.,This report only cites unnamed ""industry sources."" However, it falls in line with recent SSD pricing. It's gotten to the point where ,, so long as you don't need terabytes upon terabytes of storage.,DigiTimes said prices for 1TB gaming SSDs sat around $324 per unit (it didn't specify in what time period exactly), then hit roughly $259 in early 2018 and have finally settled at around just $97 (based on the exchange rate from New Taiwan Dollars to USD). The publication partially attributed this to ""drastic NAND price falls, driven by increases in new production capacity."",But those prices could fall even further still, with DigiTimes reporting a projected 15 percent drop in the first quarter of 2019, due to ""weakening total bit demand for PC-use SSDs and SSD price falls."" That's bad news for storage makers but great for consumers.,Memory is also , ""as memory makers are under increasing pressure to digest inventories amid strong wait-and-see sentiment in terminal markets,"" DigiTimes added. ,Those shifts don't only benefit consumers. AMD is also said to have become increasingly popular among manufacturers because of Intel's ongoing ,. The lack of Intel , has led people to hold off other system upgrades, but that obviously doesn't help vendors with financial targets to hit. Instead, they're faced with the option of either holding off on releasing new products or , until things are settled.,It might be hard to enjoy these decreasing prices when you consider what caused them. But after years of having to overpay for , and storage, it's nice to be able to make an upgrade without having to sacrifice your firstborn to afford the purchase."
Toshiba Starts Sampling World’s First UFS 3.0 Embedded Flash Chips,"Toshiba announced the industry’s first embedded flash chips to use the ultra-fast Universal Flash Storage (UFS) version 3.0 technology. The new memory chips target smartphones, tablets, and augmented/virtual reality systems.,Toshiba said that the new chips use the cutting-edge 96-layer BiCS FLASH, the company’s 3D flash memory technology, and a controller in a JEDEC-standard 11.5 x 13mm package. Chips will be made available in three capacities: 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB.,The controller performs error correction, wear leveling, logical-to-physical address translation, and bad-block management for simplified system development.,All three devices are compliant with JEDEC UFS 3.0, as well as the HS-GEAR4 standard, which has a theoretical interface speed of up to 11.6 Gigabits per second per lane. With two lanes, the chips can reach a peak interface bandwidth of 23.2Gbps (2.9GB/s).,Toshiba didn't disclose the read and write speed of the chips, but it noted that the 512GB drives will support an increased read and write performance over the previous generation of 70 percent and 80 percent, respectively.,Toshiba is no stranger to JEDEC’s UFS memory standard, as it was also the first company to release UFS samples back in 2013, just as now, six years later, it’s the first to sample UFS 3.0 embedded memory chips.,The UFS standard has started to gain , over the past few years, as a higher-performance alternative to eMMC. Samsung and other companies have even started to use the standard for ,, as an alternative to SD cards.,Sampling of Toshiba’s 128GB chip started today, and smartphones using it are expected to ship later this year."

Storage Wars: Backblaze Releases Full 2018 Report,"Backblaze has released the 2018 installment of its , report. These reference materials reveal how many drives the cloud storage provider is using, how often those drives fail, and how those failure rates compare to previous years. They can also , in the storage industry--such as the increased availability of higher capacity drives--for anyone who doesn't usually pay attention to where things are heading.,The report looks promising: annualized failure rates across every category of HDD is on a steady decline. Backblaze said that 1.95 percent of its drives failed in 2016, 1.77 percent failed in 2017, and 1.25 percent failed in 2018. The absolute numbers of failed drives rose year-over-year because the company is using more drives than before, but in general, it seems that more of the company's HDDs are surviving their daily hardships than ever.,Those figures are based on the company's usage of 104,778 hard drives spread across 15 models made by HGST, Seagate, Toshiba, and Western Digital. (It also has another 176 drives excluded from testing because it doesn't use at least 45 of the same model, as well as 1,965 boot drives.) You can see a full breakdown of how often a particular model has, well, broken down over the last three years in Backblaze's comparison chart:,There's a marked difference in failure rates between the new 12TB and 14TB drives the company started using this year and its other HDDs. This could be caused by problems with a specific product; it could also mean that Backblaze hasn't yet figured out how to properly integrate these drives. Either way, there's a big jump from the 0 percent failure rate of Toshiba's 5TB MD04ABA500V and that same manufacturer's 14TB MG07ACA14TA.,A caveat: Tom's Hardware can't speak to the data presented by Backblaze. The company is using far more drives than we could ever reasonably test, and even if we did want to blow the budget for the next decade on a bunch of spinning discs, we wouldn't use the exact same configuration as Backblaze. We're presenting the information as-is and hope it's clear that we aren't advocating for or against certain products based on this report.,And, to be fair, Backblaze makes similar caveats in the report itself. In the preface for this year's installment, the company acknowledged that it called the first Hard Drive Stats report published in 2014 “What Hard Drive Should I Buy,” and said, ""that might have been a bit of an overreach"" in hindsight. Notice that it's no longer recommending drives to consumers; it's merely sharing information about the performance of the drives its business relies on.,The information behind Backblaze's report is available on ,. It's also planning a ""Backblaze Hard Drive Stats for 2018"" webinar for January 24 at 10am PT for subscribers to the ,. This webinar is expected to ""dig deeper into the quarterly, yearly, and lifetime hard drive stats and include the annual and lifetime stats by drive size and manufacturer."""
Micron and Western Digital Reveal 1TB microSD Cards,"The era of 1TB microSD cards is here. Micron and Western Digital both announced 1TB microSDXC UHS-I cards at MWC Barcelona 2019. Micron's is called the Micron c200 1TB microSDXC UHS-I, which is as descriptive as it is easy to remember, while Western Digital's offering will be sold as the SanDisk Extreme microSDXC UHS-I.,Our need for more storage rises in step with the capabilities of the computers in our pockets, so it's no longer enough to store a few gigabytes worth of data. Now we're playing graphically intense games, shooting 4K video, and storing other content on our phones. As such, both cards are primarily meant for use in smartphones.,As Micron said in its press release about the new 1TB card:,“Micron’s technology leadership in 3D NAND with CMOS under the array and 96-layer QLC has been instrumental in developing and launching the world’s first 1TB microSD card,” said Aravind Ramamoorthy, senior director of NAND solutions for Micron's Embedded Business Unit. “The new c200 1TB microSD card gives consumers the freedom to capture, share, store and enjoy more content while supporting their mobile-centric lifestyles.”,It also isn't enough to offer high capacity storage--otherwise, people would be content to connect external hard drives to their phones. Storage has to be small enough to fit into the phone itself, have a high enough capacity to handle everything we want to store and be fast enough that we don't grow impatient.,These cards are supposed to meet all those criteria. They fit everywhere a microSDXC card does boast up to 1TB of storage, and offer up to 100MB/s read and 95MB/s write (Micron), or 160MB/s read and 90MB/s write (Western Digital) speeds. That's said to be fast enough to handle 4K UHD video recording and playback easily.,Both cards also meet the ,specification, which means they're fine to use for mobile apps. As we said, they should be good-to-go for data-hungry smartphones.,Micron said it plans to release the Micron c200 1TB microSDXC UHS-I card in 2Q19; it didn't reveal pricing information. Western Digital plans to release the SanDisk Extreme microSDXC UHS-I in April 2019 in two capacities, 512GB and 1TB, for a respective $200 and $450. The card's available to reserve ,.,That price discrepancy highlights the fact that the era of 1TB microSD cards is really only beginning. Most people aren't going to spend $450 on 1TB of storage--especially as prices for desktop storage continue to fall--instead of buying the $200 offering. Enthusiasts will, of course, but the average consumer won't.,Still, it won't be too long until the price of the 1TB card falls in line with the 512GB offering. People are getting too data-hungry (and too used to paying a pittance for storage) for prices to remain that high for too long. This is a glimpse at the future, not a sign that everyone will have 1TB microSD cards in a month."
MicroSD Cards Gain Support for High-Speed NVMe Interface,"At the Mobile World Congress conference in Barcelona today, the SD Association announced the new microSD Express standard based on the ,.,The SD Association announced the microSD Express interface as part of the new SD 7.1 specification and some manufacturers have already announced microSD cards that support it.,The need for higher-speed microSD has increased primarily due to more smartphones gaining support for , video recording at 60 frames per second (fps), as well as for 960 fps slow-motion videos, which can turn into very large files very quickly. Higher-speed microSDs are also increasingly needed for the ever-evolving gaming systems, multi-channel IoT devices, numerous automotive uses, action cameras, 360-degree videos and , use cases.,Hiroyuki Sakamoto, SDA president, in a statement said: “microSD Express gives the mobile industry a compelling new choice to equip mobile devices with removable SSDs. SD 7.1 prepares consumers and mobile device manufacturers to meet ever increasing storage demands for years to come.”,The microSD Express interface uses the PCIe 3.1 and NVMe v1.3 specifications defined by PCI-SIG and NVM Express, respectively. PCIe 3.1 comes with support for low-power states, which enable the low-power implementation of SD Express for mobile devices. The power utilized by microSD Express cards for data transfers is expected to be less than what traditional microSD cards consumed.,The SD Association and NVM Express Inc believe that microSD Express cards could be rapidly embraced in future products as consumers start to treat microSDs more like , for their mobile devices.,Amber Huffman, NVM Express Inc. president, said: “NVMe is the industry-recognized performance SSD interface from the client to the data center to mobile, shipping in millions of units. By SDA adopting NVMe technology into the new microSD Express cards, users can experience lower latency and increasingly fast transfer speeds across various applications.” "
Crucial's Newest 1 TB SSD Is Just $119,"Pricing has plunged ever since SSDs were first introduced to consumers. Whereas a 1TB SSD would have been a rather high-end product just a year or two ago, now 1TB of solid-state storage is firmly in the mid-range.,That's not just because of semi-frequent discounts, but also due to , that now offers a 1TB model for a mere $119 at Newegg. Crucial still offers its existing capacities of 120, 240, and 480GB.,Crucial's BX500 SATA SSDs come in the 2.5-inch form factor, which is to be expected at such low prices, but it does offer up to 540 MB/s and 500 MB/s of sequential read/write throughput.,The drive also doesn't come with any DRAM, which has been used on SSDs of all sorts to speed up random reads and writes. However, even without DRAM, this SSD would probably be fine for anything including a game drive, an OS boot drive, and general storage. But before you plunk down your hard-earned cash, make sure that you adjust your expectations accordingly. In either case, ,, it's hard to argue against the value this SSD could bring to the market. It also includes a three-year warranty.,Crucial has not specified a launch date on the product page (where this SSD was first discovered), but as it has been listed one could expect it to launch relatively soon. We already have a ,, but keep your eyes peeled for our review of the 1TB model."
New OWC ThunderBlade External SSD Offers Pro Speeds With a Price to Match,"Other World Computing (OWC) has released the second generation of its ThunderBlade external SSD. The drive should offer strong performance, thanks to the not-quite-namesake Thunderbolt 3 ports, but it has the price tag to match.,ThunderBlade starts at $799 for a 1TB drive and goes all the way to $3,499 for an 8TB drive, with numerous models in between. Those prices alone are enough to push the drives from ""enthusiast product"" to ""something you should only buy on the company's dime."",If you can scrounge up the cash, here's the rundown. ThunderBlade is essentially several M.2 NVMe drives in a case that’s supposed to be compact enough to travel. It comes with its own ballistic hard-shell case, too, so OWC actually expects people to move the drive around (perhaps because if you’re willing to pay for a drive like this, waiting for terabytes of information to transfer via the cloud is hardly an option). It’s compatible with Mac and Windows devices featuring Thunderbolt, Thunderbolt 2, or Thunderbolt 3; the last offers the best performance.,OWC claims the second-gen ThunderBlade offers up to 2,800 MB/s read and 2,450 MB/s write transfer speeds on its own. Use two of 'em in a SoftRAID (OWN's own RAID tool) setup though, and the company claims they ""can reach dizzying heights up to 3,800 MB/s.” You can also daisy chain up to six Thunderbolt 3 devices, and the ThunderBlade offers two ports to easily enable that setup.,So who is this for? The SSD is targeting creative professionals. Media creation is probably the most obvious example. People making a movie, dealing with complex 3D models, etc. want to be able to access huge files on a moment’s notice. High-capacity, high-speed SSDs fit the bill. For everyone else? Yes, we’re ,, but the typical consumer doesn't need drives like these.,But those who really need this combination of capacity and performance can get the second-gen ThunderBlade now ,."
Toshiba Announces BG4 NVMe SSD Series,"We recently reviewed Toshiba’s latest client SSD, the ,. With it came the release of 96-Layer TLC BiCS flash which enabled improved performance and power efficiency over the previous XG5, making it a great SSD for system builders. Today marks the release of the fourth generation BGA SSD, the BG4. Just like the XG6, Toshiba’s new BG4 features 96-Layer memory and also a new controller to deliver improved performance and efficiency. Toshiba claims that makes it a perfect fit for ultra-mobile and embedded designs such 2-in-1s and IOT devices.,“When it comes to performance, the BG4 series bests client SATA drives by a factor of up to 4x. Better performance along with its optimized power consumption and compact footprint is why the BG4 SSDs are rapidly replacing SATA SSDs in notebook and desktop PCs.” - Alvaro Toledo Vice President of SSD Marketing and Product Planning at Toshiba Memory America,The BG4 uses a new controller that communicates with the host system via the latest NVMe 1.3b protocol. It uses four PCIe lanes rather than just two like most mainstream NVMe SSDs. The added lanes boost performance up to 2,250/1,700 MB/s of read/write throughput. Performance in random workloads has also improved over 150%, up to 380,000/190,000 IOPS read/write.,We would normally expect this type of performance from a larger SSD with onboard DRAM. But instead of a relatively large 2280 form factor, the BG4 is very small. The minuscule SSD comes two form factors: either as a surface-mounted BGA M.2 1620 (16 x 20mm), or a removable M.2 2230 (22 x 30mm) module. The BGA package has a Z-height (thickness) of just 1.3mm for capacities that reach up to 512GB, ad 1.5mm for the 1TB model. Toshiba claims it is the densest client SSD by volumetric measurements.,While it doesn’t utilize a DRAM cache on its own, just like the BG3, it utilizes the NVMe Host Memory Buffer feature to cache the table map on the host system’s RAM. Toshiba has made other improvements to its HMB implementation that include increased accelerated read access ranges, more optimized background flash management, and enhanced reliability features to protect against host DRAM failures.,Compared to BG3 series, the new BG4 SSDs provide up to a 20% improvement in power efficiency and a low-power state that dips as low as 5mW. Capacities range from 128GB all the way up to 1TB SSDs that are currently sampling to select OEMs. General availability is expected in Q2 of 2019. Pyrite drive (version 1.00) or self-encrypting drive (TCG Opal version 2.01) models are also available. Toshiba says the new SSDs are priced to compete with SATA SSDs but didn't provide specific pricing. "
Seagate Wants to Ship 100TB HDDs by 2025,"Seagate wants to help you build your own Library of Alexandria--or maybe just store your entire Steam library locally. According to a company roadmap ,, the company plans to introduce 50TB hard drives ""early next decade,"" with HDDs boasting capacities up to 100TB expected to arrive sometime around 2025.,Those future high-capacity HDDs would be made using Seagate's Heat Assisted Magnetic Recording (HAMR) technology. Or at least HAMR would be used to establish the foundation--the proposed 100TB drives would have to combine the technology with bit-patterned media to create the Heated-Dot Magnetic Recording (HDMR) technology that promises to enable even greater storage density at the cost of a much-less-catchy acronym.,HAMR essentially uses tiny lasers to rapidly heat recording bits over 400C, making it easier to magnetize the media. The bits cool just as rapidly--they're only subjected to the heat for a nanosecond--but the effects linger. (See more on HAMR and how it works ,.) In 2017 Seagate announced its plans to release 20TB drives in 2019 and 40TB drives in 2023. Now those expectations are even higher.,Not that Seagate's the only company pushing HDD capacities over the next few years. Western Digital , called Microwave Assisted Magnetic Recording (MAMR) that offers similar promises of massive amounts of storage. The company doesn't plan to bring MAMR hard drives to the consumer market, though, with its focus remaining on high capacity HDDs for enterprise use and SSDs for consumers.,The enterprise market is where these high-capacity hard drives are likely to have the most impact anyway. Many consumers , in recent years for several reasons, including declining prices and their appeal to our collective impatience. HDDs still have their place--especially when it comes to backing up large amounts of data. But unless you have several terabytes of files that you need to store locally, we still recommend SSDs for most consumers.,Still, it wouldn't be surprising to see these high capacity HDDs trickle down to consumers eventually. As people continue to shift to digital media and accumulate decades of family photos and video, hard drives will still have their place because they offer the best dollars-to-data ratio. We'll know more about these future bit buckets as Seagate and Western Digital's HAMR and MAMR (and eventually HDMR) hard drives get closer to reality in the coming years."
Big Storage Deal: 12TB Seagate IronWolf HDD for $349,"It's a basic rule of tech: The leading-edge products cost more. For hard drives, that means the most capacious models carry the big pricing premium, while stepping down just one step on the ladder will save you big dollars. Take Seagate's 14TB IronWolf drive, for instance. That model retails for an eye-popping $580, meaning you pay ~$40 per terabyte of storage.,But if you step down to the 12TB IronWolf, you only pay $29 per terabyte for the next two days. That's because ,. It also comes with free shipping.,You'll get a 7,200-RPM drive that supports the SATA interface and is designed for NAS use, meaning it has rigorous data protection mechanisms and is designed for 24/7 use. But the drive, which is designed to higher quality and reliability requirements than desktop drives, will work just as well in your desktop PC. In fact, this 12TB NAS drive is retailing for less than 12TB desktop HDDs at the moment. So, if you're looking to upgrade your NAS or desktop PC storage, now is a great time to pick up a new hard drive on the cheap."
China: US Action Against Fujian Jinhua Violates WTO Regulation,"Following the U.S. Department of Commerce's , selling to Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit Co., Ltd, a Chinese DRAM maker, Chinese officials have claimed the action violated World Trade Organization (WTO) rules in an effort to protect a monopoly held by a U.S. company.,According to a , report today, China complained to the WTO that “we consider this an unwarranted charge and firmly oppose the presumption of guilt to our companies” and that ""the real purpose of the U.S. measures is to maintain the monopoly interests of the U.S. DRAM industry."" Presumably the country wants the WTO to convince the U.S. to un-circle the wagons and let U.S. companies ship Fujian Jinhua's supplies once again.,It's worth noting the Department of Commerce didn't mention a specific American company in its announcement. Instead, the federal organization said that Fujian Jinhua's plans to ramp up its DRAM production posed a national security risk because it ""threatens the long-term economic viability of U.S. suppliers of these essential components of U.S. military systems,"" with the idea being that Fujian Jinhua had stolen various technologies from the U.S.,But it's reasonable to suspect that the Department of Commerce was acting to protect Micron, which has repeatedly accused Fujian Jinhua and other Chinese firms of stealing its technologies. Micron and Fujian Jinhua have both used their respective local regulators to hinder one another's efforts. Certain Micron products were barred from parts of China before the U.S. made its own announcement. ,Not that the U.S. and China needed another reason to quarrel. Tensions have escalated between the countries in recent months as the Trump administration threatens tariffs on up to $200 billion worth of goods imported to the U.S. from China (you can read more in our previous coverage on what ,and ,).,Fujian Jinhua, for its part, has ,the Department of Commerce's accusations. Micron has done the same for China's."
Samsung 860 QVO QLC SSD Spotted In Europe,"Several European hardware retailers have listed Samsung's upcoming 860 QVO (Quality and Value Oriented) SSD on their online stores. The 860 QVO represents Samsung's first excursion into the QLC (quad-level cell) NAND territory.,The Samsung 860 QVO is a conventional 2.5-inch SSD that still relies on the ubiquitous SATA III interface to communicate with the rest of the system. According to the listings, the SSD comes with QLC 3D NAND flash memory, which results in increased density, and thus lower pricing, than other types of flash, like TLC. Unfortunately, as we've seen with other new QLC SSDs, the new flash can come with lower performance and endurance. ,Despite the challenges of QLC flash, Samsung's QVO pumps out up to 550/520 MB/s of sequential read/write throughput and up to 96,000/89,000 random read/write IOPS. ,The Samsung 860 QVO's sequential performance is right in line with the Samsung 860 EVO, but it falls behind the 860 EVO's 98,000/90,000 random read/write specifications. This is understandable given the Samsung 860 QVO's focus on value rather than speed. Performance seekers should probably pick up the EVO or PRO models.,As with all the latest Samsung SSDs, the Samsung 860 QVO features the company's TurboWrite Technology which helps boost the drive's write performance. The SSD will be available in three capacities: 1TB (MZ-76Q1T0BW), 2TB (MZ-76Q2T0BW), and 4TB (MZ-76Q4T0BW).,An , listed the Samsung 860 QVO with a limited three-year warranty and an endurance up to 1,440 TBW (terabytes written), which is probably for the 4TB model. On the other hand, a , listed the Samsung 860 QVO with a five-year warranty. ,Samsung's current 860 EVO 1TB currently retails for $127.98 (£148.80) while the 2TB and 4TB models retail for $294.88 (£357.97) and $797.99 (£778.85), respectively. If NAS Expert's pricing is accurate, the Samsung 860 QVO will be significantly less expensive than the Samsung 860 EVO at higher densities of 2TB and 4TB.,Although Samsung hasn't released any official information around the 860 QVO, European retailers expect the SSD to launch in December 2018."
Flash Deal: Adata SU655 480GB SSD Now $48,"An SSD is one of the best upgrades you can get to breathe new life into an existing computer, because they are  four or five times faster than your average hard drive. If you're sick of waiting ages for Windows and your programs to load, you're in for a real treat. Adata's , SSD is available at Amazon for $48.,The Adata SU655 480GB adheres to the 2.5-inch form factor and communicates with your system through an old-school SATA interface. Therefore, the SSD will practically fit into the oldest of desktops and laptops as long as there's SATA port onboard.,The SU655 is built with the latest 3D NAND technology and delivers up to to 520/450 MB/s of sequential read/write throughput and up to 40,000/75,000 random read/write IOPS. Adata rates the 480GB model with an endurance up to 280 TBW (terabytes written).,With 480GB in capacity, the Adata SU655 is a perfect fit for personal, gaming, and business systems. Adata backs the SSD up with a three-year warranty."
NAND Flash Makers to Cut Capex by 2% in 2019 - DRAMeXchange,"DRAMeXchange has , NAND flash manufacturers will continue to reduce their capital expenditure (capex) by 2 percent in 2019. The reductions are mostly expected to come from South Korean flash manufacturers, but the research group said that U.S. manufacturers will probably reduce their capex as well, despite global capital expenditure already declining by a reported 10 percent between 2017 and 2018.,The reason for these reductions is simple: there continues to be an oversupply of NAND flash memory. DRAMeXchange said this will probably continue to be the case despite manufacturer countermeasures, simply because ""demand outlook for notebooks, smartphones, servers, and other end products remains weak."" Tech companies probably aren't going to buy a bunch of memory to put in products they're struggling to sell.,Flash manufacturers have already felt the effects of these problems. The most notable example is Samsung, which , for the most recent financial quarter because of lower-than-expected demand for its memory and its smartphones. DRAMeXchange said that Samsung represents 30 percent of the market, so if it's struggling to reach its goals, odds are good that the other NAND flash manufacturers are as well.,Samsung and other flash manufacturers will , throughout 2019 to combat these issues. (Hence the reduced capital expenditure.) Production was already expected to fall as companies switched to 92 and 96-layer 3D NAND products due to the need for more space in the fab. But now it's less ""our bit output growth will fall because we're making new products!"" and more ""we need to cut costs."",Their loss could be our gain. DRAMeXchange said that it ""expects a quarterly decline of 20% in 1Q19, higher than [the] previous forecast of 10%, and a further decline of nearly 15% QoQ in 2Q19"" and that ""for 2H19, the price decline may be slightly moderated considering the coming of peak season, but prices would continue to fall by around 10% each quarter."" All told, the group's predicting a 50-percent drop in NAND flash prices over the coming year.,Previous estimates put the drop in memory pricing in 2019 anywhere from , to ,. (Depending on the type of memory.) Watching the higher of those figures double over the course of a few months indicates that NAND flash manufacturers aren't likely to recover from their oversupply woes any time soon. But hey, at least from a consumer's perspective, who doesn't like it when prices fall?"
"World's First PCIe 4.0 SSD Demo, Phison E16 Hits 4GB/s","The world of PCIe 4.0 is almost upon us, courtesy of AMD's new third-gen Ryzen 'Matisse' processors, but you can't buy any stupid-fast PCIe 4.0 devices. At least not yet.,Phison looks to change that with its new E16 NVMe SSD controller that it demoed at CES 2019. Phison sells its controllers openly to a wide range of SSD makers, so you'll see these controllers on a plethora of devices in the coming months.,Phison's demo SSD pulled down a blistering 4 GB/s of sequential read throughput and a beastly 4.2 GB/s of write performance during a CrystalBenchMark test. The company is currently using Micron's 96-layer TLC flash, but new E16-powered SSDs will also hit the market with Toshiba's BiCS 4 flash. Phison expects the faster flash to push speeds up to 4.8/4.4 GB/s of read/write throughput.,That will push around big file transfers at a blistering pace, but the E16's random performance, which is most noticeable as snappy responsiveness in the operating system and applications, weighs in north of 900,000 IOPS for both read and write workloads, setting yet another high watermark for performance.,Phison's new PCIe 4.0 x4 SSD controller is so bleeding edge that the company doesn't have a motherboard (that it can show publicly) that supports the faster standard. Instead, the company used a specialized PLDA Gen4HOST adapter card for the demo. The adapter converts the PCIe 3.0 x16 connection to a PCIe 4.0 x8 connection. No fears, though, as Phison has already certified its device as PCIe 4.0-compliant.,The PS5016-E16, as it's formally known, comes with a dual-core ARM controller paired with two of Phison's proprietary CO-X processor cores. The controller has eight addressable channels that can manage four flash packages apiece at 800 MT/s. The demo SSD was equipped with TLC flash, but Phison will also support QLC. Cheaper QLC flash isn't as endurant at TLC, but Phison's LDPC (Low-Density Parity Check) error correction will ensure that endurance is comparable to other devices.,SSDs have already begun to push the limits of the PCIe 3.0 x4 interface, so the step up to PCIe 4.0 will spur a new round of development that pushes SSD controller and flash development to the next level. Not to mention that it will allow you to fling files around at a record pace.,Phison says the SSDs will hit the market in Q3 2019."
Intel's New M.2 Optane Memory H10 SSDs: Optane Paired With QLC Flash (Updated),": We learned more at Intel's official unveiling of the new Optane Memory H10 SSDs. We've updated the article below.,Intel's speedy Optane storage products just received a face-lift. The new Optane Memory H10 model boosts overall storage capacity by pairing the speedy 3D XPoint memory with a dollop of QLC flash. That means there will soon be Optane-powered SSDs that reach up to 1TB of capacity.,As you can see in the image above, the M.2 SSD features both a QLC flash and an Optane memory package on a single PCB. The new drives use the fast Optane storage to accelerate frequently-accessed data held on the more spacious QLC flash, meaning these M.2 drives will come in one slim package with higher capacities than the ,.,The 800p SSDs only come in capacities of 58GB and 118GB and are significantly more expensive than typical flash-based SSDs. Intel's new H10 drives will still command a premium due to the pricey Optane memory, but the less-expensive QLC flash means you get much more storage capacity for your dollar.,The new Optane Memory H10 drives include two models with either 1TB or 512GB of QLC flash paired with 32GB of Optane memory. Intel also has a low-capacity model that combines 256GB of QLC storage with 16GB of Optane memory.,The H10 is essentially an , and an , crammed onto a single board. As such, the drive has a custom Intel controller for the Optane memory and a separate SMI controller for the QLC flash.,Each controller has its own PCIe 3.0 x2 pathway into the M.2 socket, and Intel's RST (Rapid Storage Technology) combines the two drives together. As a result, the drive is limited to the speed of a single PCIe 3.0 x2 connection. That will limit performance for large transfers, but you retain the speed and latency of Optane during random workloads.,The Optane memory is transparent to the operating system, so the drives only expose the QLC flash portion of the SSD to the user. As such, a drive with 1TB of QLC flash and 32GB of Optane memory appears as a 1TB drive. ,Most enthusiasts use the smaller Optane SSD 800p drives to hold their operating system while storing bulk data, like games, pictures, and videos, on a secondary drive. That tactic isn't as effective in the notebook space, largely because most lightweight devices don't come with connections for a secondary drive.,The new drives will certainly open up new opportunities for notebook users, and for Intel. The new drives will debut in Q2 in OEM systems from Dell, Lenovo, HP, Acer, Asus, and others. Intel is leading with drives for several OEM laptops, which will come to market in Q2 2019, but hasn't committed to bringing retail models to shelves. The H10 requires a motherboard that supports PCIe bifurcation, which means motherboard vendors would have to commit to releasing new BIOS revisions that support the feature.,Intel hasn't released performance specifications. QLC SSDs tend to be pretty snappy, but regular Optane drives are faster. Overall performance of the combined drives will not be as impressive as a ""pure"" Optane SSD, but intelligent caching should make the drive faster than flash-based SSDs.,Intel hasn't released specifics, but the Optane Memory H10 SSDs have a higher endurance rating than a standard QLC SSD and are backed by a five-year warranty."
DRAMa: Chinese Vendor Fujian Jinhua Denies Stealing US Firm's Trade Secrets," never gets boring. Shortly after the federal government's U.S. Department of Commerce , exporting goods to Chinese DRAM vendor Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit Co., Ltd., the company has released a statement defending itself against the claim that it stole trade secrets from a U.S. business.,According to ,, Fujian Jinhua's plan to increase DRAM production ""threatens the long-term economic viability of U.S. suppliers of these essential components of U.S. military systems,"" which means the DRAM maker ""poses a significant risk of becoming involved in activities that are contrary to the national security interests of the United States."",Quick note: The following results from a Google Translate interpretation of Fujian Jinhua's statement. You can find the full statement ,. The translation likely isn't perfect and, therefore, could twist Fujian Jinhua's message in some way. However, the following should offer a rough idea of what the company had to say:,""Jinhua Company has always firmly adhered to independent research and development routes, continuously increased investment, carried out research and development and manufacturing of memory and memory-related products and achieved a number of patent achievements. Jinhua Company always attaches great importance to the protection of intellectual property rights, and there is no behavior to steal other company technologies.,""Micron regards the development of Jinhua as a threat and adopts various means to prevent and destroy the development of Jinhua. The United States has included Jinhua in the U.S.' 'list of entities for export control' and has taken judicial measures. In this regard, Jinhua Company resolutely safeguards the legitimate rights and interests of enterprises, requires the other party to immediately stop wrong practices and facilitates and promotes the normal trade and cooperation between the two enterprises."",The Department of Commerce didn't say which U.S. technologies it believed Fujian Jinhua used for its DRAM products, but the company has gone back and forth with Micron over allegations of patent infringement and theft of intellectual property. Fujian Jinhua and another DRAM maker, United Microelectronics Corporation, were , that prevented Micron from selling select products in China.,This makes the Department of Commerce's decision the latest in a series of conflicts between the U.S. and China in recent months. (More on those ,, which include tariffs threatening , of goods originating from China, can be found in ,.) But just like Micron , when the Chinese government barred it in July, Fujian Jinhua had a few things to say itself."
"Western Digital Announces Embedded, 96-Layer 3D NAND Drive for Thin Devices","Western Digital has announced its new embedded flash drive, which uses 96-layer 3D NAND memory. The iNAND MC EU321 can be embedded in all sorts of computing devices, from ,to PCs.,Western Digital’s iNAND MC EU321 will be available with capacities between 32GB and 256GB, supports a a UFS 2.1 Gear3 2-lane interface and comes with an in-house controller. The drive features a performance of 800MB/s sequential read speed, 550MB/s sequential write speed, as well as up to 50/52K random read/write IOPS.,The BGA package of the iNAND MC EU321 measures 11.5×13×1mm, which makes it small enough to fit in slim laptops, but also in tablets, smartphones and even ,.,Western Digital says its SmartSLC 5.1 caching technology ensures that the device maintains high performance, even when the drive is almost full. The single-level cell (SLC) buffer can clean up fragmented data when the device is idle. The SmartSLC 5.1, which brings a 10 percent improvement in performance over the previous generation, is optimized for high-resolution photography, fast file transfer and content download.,Western Digital has been using the industry-leading 96-layer 3D NAND memory technology since at least April. The company also introduced its first 96-layer SSD in June. Many ,, including Western Digital, have been using 96-layer SSD technology in conjunction with quad-level cell (QLC) technology to , and lower cost, offering customers more GBs for a lower price.,However, the QLC SSDs should normally last less than MLC, TLC or SLC drives, which is why most companies also take advantage of SLC caches so that the QLC portion on the drive is less utilized and can last longer.,Western Digital didn't say when its embedded storage flash drive will start shipping, but it's expected to arrive soon on the market."
Intel M.2 Optane SSD 905P Goes Up for Pre-Order at $500,"Intel first demonstrated the M.2 version of its , in April during ,. Making good on its promise to release the drive before the end of the year, the SSD launches on November 18.,The Intel M.2 Optane SSD 905P adheres to the M.2 22110 standard and therefore measures 22mm wide by 110mm long. The drive is built around Intel's , and has a capacity of 380GB. Just like your typical M.2 PCIe SSD, the M.2 Optane SSD 905P utilizes a ,.,Intel hooked up with Slovenian watercooling specialist EK Waterblocks (EKWB) to outfit the M.2 Optane SSD 905P with a dark grey aluminium passive heat sink. EKWB's heat sink consists of a front cover and backplate that are attached to the SSD via stainless steel clips. Although the heat sink features a fairly compact design, it will surely prevent the M.2 Optane SSD 905P from being installed inside ultra-thin devices, such as Ultrabooks. The good news is that the heat sink is removable; however, doing so might hinder the SSD's performance.,At the time of writing, Intel hasn't released performance numbers for the M.2 Optane SSD 905P. But it's safe to say that the drive probably won't be as fast as the AIC (add-in-card) and U.2 variants, which boast sequential read and write speeds up to 2,700MB/s and 2,200MB/s, respectively, and 4K random read and write speeds up to 575,000 IOPS and 550,000 IOPS, respectively. However, the M.2 variant does consume comparably less power at idle and when active. Intel backs the M.2 Optane SSD 905P with a five-year warranty.,The Intel M.2 Optane SSD 905P 380GB (SSDPEL1D380GAX1) is currently available for preorder at , for $499.99. The purchase is limited to two per customer. According to Newegg, the SSD's official launch date is November 18, and it'll probably be shipped to customers shortly afterwards."
"Crucial Has a 500GB, QLC NAND SSD on Amazon Japan","The sun has risen a little early on Crucial's new P1 series , equipped with Micron's quad-level cell (QLC) NAND. Crucial hasn't announced the drive, but it's , as the ""Crucial SSD M.2 500 GB P1 series Type 2280 PCIe 3.0 × 4 NVMe 5 year warranty CT 500 P 1 SSD 8 JP."" More information has also become available via ,, but there still hasn't been an announcement for the U.S. market.,Pretty much everything about Crucial's new P1 SSD is found in the Amazon Japan posting. It's a 500GB drive in the Type 2280 form factor that comes with a five-year warranty. In terms of performance, the listing claims that the drive offers up to 1,900MB/s sequential read, 950MB/s sequential write speeds and up to 90,000 IOPS and 220,000 IOPS for random read and write, respectively.,The listing also says capacity can be expanded from 500GB to 2TB and that the new drive has a mean time to failure of 1.8 million hours. Crucial's UK website backs that up with the revelation of 1TB and 2TB drives, with the latter being marked as ""coming soon."" In addition to their varying capacities, the 1TB and 2TB drives offer improved performance over their 500GB counterpart, which can be seen below.,We expected to see either Micron or Toshiba release their 64-layer NAND at some point this year. The companies , for the QLC crown for a while, and , to release the next-gen storage technology sometime this year. Micron , that it was shipping 5210 SSDs ranging in capacity from 1.92TB to 7.68TB to strategic partners and customers. Now, a QLC drive is reaching consumers.,Amazon Japan listed Crucial's new QLC NAND drive at ¥15,066 with standard delivery. That's roughly $135, and considering the stated 500GB capacity, that could offer an idea of where QLC NAND drives will sit in the market. Micron previously said QLC's 1 terabit die density provides 33 percent more storage capacity than its MLC NAND die, which could in turn lead to a 33 percent price reduction, but that doesn't seem to be the case here."
WD Slashing Output Amid Looming SSD Price Bust,"Western Digital told shareholders this week that it plans to delay the deployment of capital equipment and reduce wafer starts to reduce its output by 10-15 percent for CY19. The move follows a report claiming , in 2019 as manufacturers outside of Western Digital continue to increase their output, switch to denser storage technologies and contend with increasingly hostile trade environments.,This shift has been a long time coming. Back in January, we predicted that ,, and in June, that prediction ,. Some manufacturers have simply rolled with the punches. Others, like Western Digital and ,, have decided to limit their production for 2019 to help keep prices stable or even allow them to climb a bit.,Declining SSD prices can be great for consumers. We're finally reaching the point where it might be feasible ,. But these falling prices could have significant effects on companies like Western Digital, which announced yesterday that its revenue and operating income fell to $5 billion and $705 million, respectively in the most recent fiscal quarter, compared to the $5.2 billion in revenue and $905 million in operating income from the previous year.,In an earnings call, Western Digital named numerous factors were responsible for this dip, from declining consumer demand to increasingly tense relations between the U.S. and China. And ""tense"" might be an understatement, with the U.S. government , on goods originating in China as part of a trade war that could have ,, the , and ,.,But the looming trade war isn't the only problem; supply and demand are too. Western Digital CEO Stephen Milligan ,:,""This softening demand, in combination with increased flash supply, has led to a market imbalance resulting in a deteriorating near-term flash pricing environment. In response to these conditions, we are making an immediate reduction to wafer starts and delaying deployment of capital equipment. These actions will reduce our wafer output beginning in fiscal Q3 2019. The goal of these actions is to better align our output with the projected global demand for flash. The duration of the planned output reduction will depend upon market conditions and will not impact our ability to meet customer commitments nor will it impede our ability to deliver the most innovative and cost-competitive solutions to the market."",Western Digital's stock price plummeted after the earnings call, with trading falling from $54.01 on the close of October 25 to $42.11 on the morning of October 26. Analysts , in response to the declining revenues. So while many enthusiasts might be excited by declining SSD prices, the penny counters at companies like Western Digital aren't nearly as keen on the circumstances leading to that fall."
Samsung Announces QLC SSDs And Second-Gen Z-NAND,"Samsung made a few important announcements about its memory and storage products at its Samsung Tech Day event. The face of data storage is changing rapidly as new denser and cheaper forms of flash worm their way to market. Samsung led the industry to the first SSDs powered by 3D NAND, affording it an advantage that it turned into a multi-year leadership position in the storage market. Interestingly, the company has lagged competitors on the QLC front, with both Intel and Micron already shipping QLC SSDs into several market segments. But Samsung will soon bring its own QLC products to market under a new line of QVO-branded SSDs.,Samsung has been on a steady march to increase the density of its 3D V-NAND that debuted five years ago. Samsung's previous-gen V4 flash landed at 64 layers, but now the company plans to step up to ~90 layers with V5.,V5 brings another important improvement beyond just the obvious increase in layers: The company is producing its newest flash in both TLC and QLC flavors. V5 QLC will come in a 1Tb die that is 33% denser than TLC. Samsung is also spinning a higher-performance 512Gb density die that it says will be faster than competing QLC flash. Samsung claims the new high-performance variant boasts 37% faster read latency and 45% faster write latency than competing flash. The 1Tb die is also plenty fast – it operates at 1.4Gbps, which is nearly twice as fast as other flash that operates in the 800Mbps range.,String Stacking, also known as multi-stack, has become the most commonly used technique to boost 3D flash layer counts. This manufacturing process essentially consists of multiple 'stacks' of 32-layer flash layered atop one another. All of Samsung's competitors use string stacking, which adds cost and complexity to the manufacturing process, but Samsung is sticking to single-stack flash for the V5 generation. Samsung claims this will reduce costs by boosting production quality and yields.,Samsung also announced that is working on V6 flash and has plans for further improvements in successive generations. V6 will debut at <100 layers, but like V5, Samsung isn't sharing the exact layer count. The company did say it will use string stacking with the next-gen flash.,Samsung also has plans for V7-10 and beyond, which it says will eventually expand to 500 or more layers over the next ten years. Samsung has cooked up a few new technologies to further its goals. This includes Cell Over Peripheral, which is similar to Intel and Micron's CuA (CMOS Under the Array), and shrinking the cells laterally. Samsung will also string stack multiple V-NAND stacks when single stack technology ceases to scale effectively.,Samsung will refresh its current products with the new V5 TLC flash and develop new V5 QLC-based SSDs for enterprise and data centers. Those drives are designed to replace 10K HDDs that are used for warm data storage applications.,Samsung will also introduce the 970 EVO Plus with V5 TLC NAND. The new Samsung EVO Plus will still come in capacities up to 2TB, but Samsung has boosted throughput to a beastly 3 GB/s, a 500 MB/s increase.,Samsung also announced a new 860 QVO SATA SSD, 980 QVO NVMe SSD, and a BM991 NVMe SSD. The new 860 QVO and 980 QVO may be next-gen retail products, like the 860 and 970 EVO, but Samsung is being coy with the details.,The QLC lineup includes six new SSDs. Features like Extreme ECC and V-NAND State Stabilizer will help maintain data integrity and provide ""machine learning-based data protection,"" proving some buzzwords transcend all boundaries. Three of the new drives are enterprise/datacenter oriented. The BM1733 and BM9A3 use the NVMe interface, and the BM1653 connects via SAS.,The BM1733 will come in an NF1 form factor for data center use and U.2 for enterprise with dual port connectivity. The BM1733 will also support capacities up to 32TB and speeds of up to 10GB/s through a dual-port PCIe Gen4 interface.,Samsung added the PM1733 to their lineup, superseding the PM1723b. The PM1733 boasts capacities that range from 1.6TB up to 30.72TB. The SSD leverages an upgraded dual-port PCIe Gen4 interface to push up to 8/3.8GB/s of sequential read/write throughput and up to 1.5 million random read IOPS and 250,000 random write IOPS.,Samsung designed Z-NAND to be a cheaper alternative to Intel’s Optane. Instead of starting from a blank drawing board, the company simply modified existing SLC flash by shrinking the wordlines and bitlines. The first gen Z-NAND die featured a 64Gb density and read/program latency of 3us/100us.,Samsung’s second-gen Z-NAND now comes in both SLC and MLC flavors. The SLC variant boasts double the density of their first gen, at 128Gb, and improved read/write latency of <1-3/70us. The new MLC variant doubles density to 256Gb and boasts read/program speeds of 5/150us, which represents a performance trade-off for much more capacity. Samsung is expanding its Hwaseong fab to boost production. ,Second-gen Z-SSDs come in capacities ranging from 800GB up to 4TB. The SZ1733 and SZ1735 slot in as the SLC models and unnamed MLC Z-NAND products will follow later.,The SZ1735 is rated for up to 30 drive writes per day throughout its five-year warranty. It has 4K read latencies of ~16us, delivers up to  3GB/s of sequential throughput and 750K/250K random read/write IOPS. Future Z-NAND-based SSDs should follow with performance of up to 12GB/s via the PCIe Gen4 interface."
Western Digital Shutting Down Hard Drive Factory,"With the SSD and NAND flash memory markets booming, Western Digital has made the tough decision to shut down its HDD (hard disk drive) manufacturing factory in Petaling Jaya, Malaysia by the end of 2019.,Western Digital first opened up shop in Malaysia in 1973. Its 1,000,000 square-foot Petaling Jaya factory commenced operations manufacturing custom semiconductors, but gradually transitioned to producing consumer and enterprise hard drives. Western Digital would then later expand the Petaling Jaya factory with its own $1.2 billlion dollar R&D facility. However, Western Digital has been in a slump the last couple of years.,HGST Technologies Malaysia, one of Western Digital's subsidiaries, closed the doors on its Bayan Lepas factory about two years ago. Once the Petaling Jaya factory goes out of commission, Western Digital will have no other choice but to spread out hard drive production between its remaining factories. Luckily, the major hard drive manufacturer still owns a 1.7 million square-foot facility in Bang Pa-In, Thailand and a 730,000 square-foot production facility in Prachinburi, Thailand. ,However, the closure of Western Digital's Petaling Jaya factory doesn't mean that the American hard-drive manufacturer is giving up on Malaysia. The company has hard drive substrate manufacturing facilities in Johor and Kuching. Western Digital's SSD assembly and test facilities, media manufacturing lines and R&D offices are also situated in Penang. According to a Western Digital spokesperson, the hard drive maker has plans to expand its SSD production capacity. The company is on the verge of opening its second SSD facility at Penang. It expects the facility to start production in the coming months.,Let's not forget that Western Digital forged a , in 2017. So, the hard drive expert already has an arsenal of SSDs at its disposal and it will continue to supply them to markets where there is a decline in demand for conventional hard drives."
QLC Flash Wars Heating Up: QLC SSDs Headed To Desktop PCs This Year,"The QLC flash wars are heating up as Intel , that it was producing its first QLC SSD for the data center. Toshiba and WD released their own QLC flash announcements shortly thereafter.,SSD pricing is already plunging due to the industry's transition to TLC flash. TLC flash stores three bits per cell, making the technology denser and cheaper than previous-gen flash. The move to QLC flash, which stores four bits per cell, promises to bring even lower prices and higher-capacity SSDs to the market soon.,But QLC flash comes with trade-offs. The extra 33% in storage density results in lower endurance and performance, but advances in 3D manufacturing technology have made the new NAND viable for light-use applications, which includes desktop PCs.,Micron started the QLC party a few months ago with the announcement of the industry's first shipping QLC SSD, so it was only natural that its flash-fabbing partner Intel would soon follow suit. Intel's tweet includes an image of its new drive, but from the exterior, it appears similar to all of Intel's previous-gen 2.5"" U.2 SSDs.,Intel's tweet says that the company's latest drives will come outfitted with the high-speed PCIe interface, so naturally, that means the drives will support the now-ubiquitous NVMe protocol. Intel promises to share more details about the new SSDs, which will become a new ""D5"" product line, at next month's Flash Memory Summit. The tweet also claims that the drives are the world's first QLC SSDs for the data center.,In either case, Intel has historically produced consumer SSDs with the same technology that it uses for the data center. Recent unconfirmed leaks indicate Intel has a new consumer QLC SSD on the roadmap for this year, so it is likely only a matter of time before its QLC flash comes to the desktop PC.,Not to be upstaged, flash partners Toshiba and WD both announced their jointly-produced 3D QLC NAND yesterday in separate announcements. The announcements contained quite a bit more information, so we know that the new 96-layer BiCS4 flash has a density of 1.33 terabits, per die.,SSDs come with up to 16 die per package, so that means Toshiba and WD will soon be able to pack in a whopping 2.66TB of storage into a single NAND package. The duo plans to begin sampling the BiCS4 QLC NAND in September and mass production is slated for early 2019. More importantly, WD's release clearly states that QLC SSDs will come to the consumer market under the SanDisk brand name. We expect Toshiba to follow suit with its own consumer SSDs.,SSDs have slowly , over the last few years and , due to reduced demand. SSD prices continue to plunge and many analyst firms predict even larger drops as the Chinese Yangtze River Storage Technology fabs begin to pump out 3D NAND. Samsung is also reportedly gearing up to increase its NAND production dramatically with a $2.6 billion increase in spending in 2019. Next year is shaping up to the year of QLC SSDs, which could be the final ingredient needed to push HDDs out of the primary storage role entirely."
Toshiba's New XG6 SSD Marks the Debut of its 96-Layer TLC Flash,"Toshiba announced that its XG6 SSD, the first drive with 96-layer flash, is sampling to OEMs. The new SSD comes with Toshiba's new 96-layer 3D TLC BiCS flash, which comes with a 40% increase in density compared to Toshiba's previous-gen 64-layer BiCS3 flash.,The XG6 SSD marks a big step forward for Toshiba's client SSDs. The M.2 SSD uses the same NVMe controller that Toshiba used with the XG5, but firmware and flash improvements, along with an update to the NVMe 1.3a spec, have yielded tremendous improvements.,Toshiba claims the XG6 reaches up to 3,180/2,960 MB/s of sequential read/write throughput and up to 355,000/365,000 random read/write IOPS over a PCIe 3.0 x4 connection.,Toshiba didn't release an official random read/write IOPS measurement for its previous-gen XG5 series, but we included our own measurements from the , in the table above. Toshiba more than doubled random read/write performance and also improved sequential write performance. Toshiba's XG6 uses an SLC buffer, so these numbers represent the best-case performance scenario.,Toshiba's XG6 tops out at 1TB in a single-sided M.2 form factor, which matches the previous-gen models. The company also plans to refresh its higher-capacity XG5-P series with the new 96-layer flash, which will bring maximum capacities up to 2TB.,Toshiba isn't sharing endurance information yet, but the XG6 is destined for mainstream read-intensive environments, like desktop PCs and OEM laptops, so it's safe to assume it isn't earth-shattering. The drives carry a five-year warranty. Toshiba hasn't shared pricing information, either. The drive is currently sampling to OEM customers and should come to the broader market in the coming months.,Toshiba's new BiCS4 flash, which it produces jointly with WD, is the real story. The new flash contends with new 96-layer flash from Samsung and 96-layer flash from partners Intel and Micron. ,, which the company accomplished by reducing the height of the layers by 20%.,In contrast, Toshiba/WD is ""String Stacking"" two 48-layer die, which essentially means the company combines two separate 48-layer die into one final product with a density of 512Gbit. That adds extra steps to the manufacturing process, which might ultimately have an impact on yields, and thus pricing. Intel and Micron are also rumored to be taking the same string stacking approach with their next-gen NAND, but they haven't shared specifics. Time will tell which approach is more economical, as both approaches have advantages and disadvantages.,Toshiba's new flash comes with the Toggle 3.0 interface, which is the communication protocol that the NAND uses to communicate with the SSD controller. Toggle 3.0 communicates at 667-800 MB/s with a 1.2V I/O, while Samsung is using a faster Toggle 4.0 interface that communicates at 1.4 Gb/s yet also features a 1.2V I/O rating.,Toshiba/WD have also recently ,, so the leading-edge 96-layer TLC SSDs will be followed by more capacious models in due course. We expect to learn more about the newest TLC and QLC flash at the Flash Memory Summit next month."
Samsung Starts Mass Production of 4TB QLC SSDs,"Samsung has entered mass production of the first 4TB QLC SATA SSDs for the consumer market. The news today comes on the cusp of this week's Flash Memory Summit, an annual storage conference where all of the newest flash and memory tech is normally announced. Samsung is usually a premier conference sponsor and dominates the show floor, but the company is curiously absent this year.,In either case, Samsung's announcement of its new 4TB QLC SSD comes on the heels of QLC announcements from,, which leaves SK Hynix as the only flash-fabber that hasn't announced a new QLC product.,Samsung based its QLC flash on the same 1TB V-NAND that it currently uses as a base for its TLC flash. TLC flash stores three bits per cell, making the technology denser and cheaper than previous-generation flash. The move to QLC flash, which stores four bits per cell, promises to bring even lower prices and higher capacity SSDs to the market soon. The extra 33% in storage density results in lower endurance and performance, but advances in 3D manufacturing technology have made the new NAND viable for light-use applications, which includes desktop PCs.,Samsung claims that it has circumvented the traditional challenges associated with QLC flash and can maintain the same speeds that it achieves with its TLC SSDs, like its ,. Samsung will continue to leverage much of its existing technology, like TurboWrite and its proprietary SSD controllers, and promises sequential throughput of 540/520MB/s read/write. Samsung hasn't provided random performance metrics or endurance, both of which are more important than sequential throughput. The 2.5-inch SATA SSD will come armed with 32 chips based on the company's 4th generation 64-layer flash.,Samsung plans to follow up with 1TB and 2TB models later in the year. Naturally, NVMe SSDs will follow, but they'll come as M.2 models for enterprise applications. The company is also developing a 128GB QLC memory card for smartphones.,Samsung hasn't provided information on shipping dates, pricing, or branding, but more details will likely emerge soon."
XPoint Shakeup: Intel and Micron to Cease Joint Development of 3D XPoint Next Year,"Intel and Micron have announced they have updated the terms of their 3D XPoint joint development partnership and will cease joint development after the second generation of 3D XPoint is completed in the first half of 2019. The two companies also recently announced they would cease joint development of NAND through their Intel-Micron Flash Technologies (IMFT) partnership after the third generation of flash technology, but the storied IMFT franchise will apparently soldier on through shared production facilities.,Intel and Micron will continue to develop new generations of 3D XPoint independently ""in order to optimize the technology for their respective product and business needs."" Intel representatives confirmed to us that the company will still produce 3D XPoint out of the jointly-operated IMFT fab in Lehi, Utah even after the companies develop their respective third-generation products, but Intel still has the option to produce the memory at other facilities if needed.,Intel and Micron ,. The companies designed the new memory to bridge the performance gap between NAND and DRAM, and because of 3D XPoint's persistence (it retains data after power is removed), it can serve in both memory and storage roles.,Micron announced its,, and we even ,, but the SSDs did not make it to market. As a result, Intel is the only company selling 3D XPoint-based products and Micron has relied on Intel to purchase its excess 3D XPoint production capacity.,However, during a recent earnings call, Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra revealed that 3D XPoint sales to Intel were flagging, thus incurring under-utilization charges that impacted Micron's bottom line. Micron even indicated that it was possible that the company wouldn't sell , 3D XPoint to Intel in the future. As such, Mehrotra announced that Micron would re-negotiate the terms of future 3D XPoint development with Intel. That means the split in product development is likely the outcome of the renegotiation. ,Sales of 3D XPoint have obviously been under expectations. Intel has brought the new memory to market in various SSD form factors, but pricing has been a concern as prices for traditional flash-based SSDs have continued to plummet. Intel has even taken to offering , in an apparent effort to spur sales.,Analysts have long predicted that the debut of ,, which bring the speedy memory to the DIMM form factor to enable explosive memory capacity increases, would mark the true turning point for 3D XPoint adoption. Unfortunately, Intel's 3D XPoint DIMMs have been plagued by delays, which ultimately has led to lower-than-expected sales.,Intel is , of its long-overdue DIMMs and claims that several hyperscalers and cloud service providers are committed to deploying its products. Micron says that it will bring its first 3D XPoint-based products to market by the end of 2019, with meaningful revenue occurring in 2020.,Both Intel and Micron have sunk a tremendous amount of R&D into the skunkworks-class project over the course of a decade, so it is unlikely that either will cease development and production. Intel and Micron have repeatedly stated that 3D XPoint is an inherently scalable design: the companies can either add more layers, shrink lithography, or store more bits per cell to boost capacity and performance. That leaves plenty of room for improvements in the future. Given the announced timeline for the second-gen products in early 2019, we could see faster, cheaper, and more capacious 3D XPoint products soon."
MyDigitalSSD's BPX Pro M.2 NVMe SSDs Debut With Up to 2TB,"MyDigitalSSD’s , BPX Pro M.2 PCIe 3.1 x4 NVMe SSDs have arrived, with capacities up to 2TB.,The new MyDigitalSSD BPX (short for Bullet Proof eXpress) Pro series SSDs feature the latest second-generation Phison E12 controller and Toshiba BiCS3 TLC NAND flash, which in combination offer sequential read and write speeds up to 3,400MB/s and 3,100MB/s, respectively, in addition to fast 4K random performance. The E12 controller also supports AES-256, TCG Opal and TCG Pyrite encryption (for secure file access) and APST, ASPM and L1.2 power saving modes (used for maximizing notebook battery life).,There are four new drives in total, all of which run on the NVMe 1.3 protocol and sport an M.2 2280 form factor with a PCIe 3.1 x4 interface.

"Seagate Announces 14TB Barracuda Pro, IronWolf, And IronWolf Pro","Seagate announced that it has bulked up the remainder of its HDD portfolio to 14TB, which should be the last generation of Seagate drives using conventional recording technology. The new 14TB drives include the Barracuda Pro models for desktop PCs, the IronWolf and IronWolf Pro series for NAS, and the SkyHawk series for surveillance applications. These new HDDs join the already-shipping 14TB Exos X14, which is designed for hyperscale data centers.,Seagate's 14TB drives use standard PMR (Perpendicular Magnetic Recording), which has been the industry's recording technology of choice for nearly a decade. Seagate's next-gen 16TB models will mark the debut of HAMR (Heat Assisted Magnetic Recording) technology, which uses tiny lasers to increase storage density.,We'll have to wait for those exciting next-gen models until next year, but Seagate's new 14TB drives mark the debut of TDMR (Two-Dimensional Magnetic Recording). TDMR uses two read elements in the drive head to improve accuracy, thus increasing storage density.,Like most modern HDDs, the new 14TB models all come with a helium design, which reduces internal turbulence by replacing the air inside the hard drive with helium. This boosts reliability and capacity while reducing weight and power consumption.,Seagate designed the $580 14TB Barracuda Pro for desktop PCs and direct-attached storage applications. The drive communicates over the SATA 6Gb/s interface and has a maximum sustained transfer rate of 250 MB/s. Seagate backs these 7,200-RPM drives with a five-year warranty that includes the company's Rescue Data Recovery Services, which will attempt to recover your data for free if the drive fails within the first two years. The eight-platter drive features the same power consumption characteristics as Seagate's 12TB drives (4.9W idle, 6.9W active) and comes with a 300TB workload limit per year.,All hard drives in the , come equipped with Seagate's Multi-Tier Caching Technology (MTC). This technology boosts HDD performance by applying intelligent layers of NAND, DRAM, or media cache. The desktop models do not use NAND caching, instead relying upon a 256MB DRAM cache and a complimentary media cache, which is a section of fast outer tracks reserved to boost the performance of frequently-accessed data. Seagate rates the Barracuda Pro drives for 300,000 load/unload cycles, which is standard for a desktop-class hard drive.,Seagate's IronWolf drives are designed for NAS applications and come with a more robust feature set than standard desktop models. That includes the company's AgileArray technology, which enables dual-plane balancing technology and RAID optimizations for multi-drive storage devices. The 7,200-RPM 6Gb/s SATA drives also come with RV (Rotational Vibration) sensors that help the drive counteract vibration in multi-bay enclosures and advanced power management features geared for NAS devices.,The standard $530 14TB IronWolf drives come with a three-year warranty and feature a maximum transfer rate of 210 MB/s. These models are designed to be used in groups of one to eight drives and come with a 180TB/year workload rating, which is surprisingly less than the Barracuda Pro desktop models (300TB/year). However, these drives are tailored for the frequent spin-up/spin-down environments found in a NAS and have a much higher 600,000 load/unload cycle rating. The drives also come with a 256MB DRAM cache and draw slightly more power than their 12TB counterparts with a 5.3W/7.9W idle/active rating (0.3W/0.1W increase, respectively).,The $600 14TB IronWolf Pro models step up to a five-year warranty that includes two years of Seagate's data recovery service. Seagate designed the Pro models to operate in groups of up to 24 drives, and they come with a more robust 300TB/year workload rating. They also offer up to 250MB/s of throughput and come with a 256MB DRAM cache. The Pro drives have the same power consumption rating as the standard IronWolf models.,Seagate also beefed up its SkyHawk line with a $510 14TB model. These drives are tailored for video surveillance applications, such as DVRs and NVRs, and can hold up to 9,000 hours of HD video from up to 64 simultaneous camera inputs. These drives come with a three-year warranty.,Seagate's new 14TB drives also mark the debut of TDMR (Two-Dimensional Magnetic Recording) in the company's drives. TDMR uses two read elements in the drive head to improve accuracy, thus increasing storage density by allowing the use of narrower tracks. The technology allowed Seagate to improve from an areal density of 923 Gb/in, to 1077 Gb/in,.,All of Seagate's new HDDs begin shipping today."
SilverStone's New M.2 SSD Riser Card Fights Overheating,"SilverStone has announced the new ECM23 M.2 PCIe SSD riser card. The company hasn't revealed all details about the device--pricing information still isn't available--but it's likely released just enough to pique the interest of those wanting better storage performance.,The , allows M.2 storage to run via PCIe connections, so performance chasers don't have to , (most probably don't mind buying new components, but the budget-constrained might like to simply buy a riser card and SSD instead of upgrading much of their system). Many motherboards are often limited to just one M.2 slot, but using a riser card like the ECM23 can help get around that limitation.,The ECM23 is compatible with AHCI over PCIe and NVMe but doesn't support plain-Jane M.2 SATA connections, according to SilverStone, which said the AHCI support is ""used for PCIe SSDs and interfaced through the AHCI driver and provided PCIe lanes, providing backward compatibility with widespread SATA support in operating systems at the cost of not delivering optimal performance."",SilverStone also tested the ECM23 with several Samsung SSDs: the, and ,, , and , were all said to ""work optimally"" with this riser card.,In addition to offering PCIe compatibility, the ECM23 offers a thermal pad and aluminum heat sink to improve the connected SSD's performance and help prevent it from overheating. Three pads are available: a small charcoal pad, a medium-sized blue pad and a large gray pad  (good luck telling the difference between ""charcoal"" and ""gray"")that are 0.5, 1 and 1.5mm thick, respectively, and vary considerably in weight.,SilverStone's announcement comes after Gigabyte revealed two new riser cards of its own, ,, in July, though neither is currently available, and their prices also have yet to be revealed. So it's clear that people interested in M.2 riser cards will soon have more options--the question is how much that extra performance will cost them. "

Gigabyte Enters PCIe M.2 SSD Race With Up to 512GB Capacity,"Gigabyte is entering the M.2 SSD market with three drives of varying capacities--128GB, 256GB, and 512GB--that promise to outperform their SATA counterparts. The 128GB and 256GB capacity drives are currently available; the 512GB capacity drive is expected to start shipping soon.,The aptly named Gigabyte M.2 PCIe SSDs offer all the usual benefits: improved performance in a smaller package that doesn't require separate power and transmission cables. In its announcement today, Gigabyte claimed its SSDs rise above competitive models because they ""must undergo and clear extreme temperature and pressure stress tests to ensure their quality and durability."" It didn't offer any specifics, though, and most products are stress-tested.,But the company is willing to put its money where its mouth is. The Gigabyte M.2 PCIe SSD is covered by a three-year or 100TB written (TBW) warranty and boasts a 1.5 million hour Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) rating. Unless you're in the habit of constantly saving, deleting and re-saving a couple dozen gigabytes of data every day (or messing with the space-time continuum), you should be good for those three years.,Performance-wise, the 128GB model offers speeds of up to 1,100MB/s sequential read, 500MB/s sequential write, 90,000 random read IOPS and 100,000 random write IOPS. For the 256GB model, those numbers increase to 1,200MB/s sequential write, 800MB/s sequential read, 80,000 random read IOPS and 150,000 random write IOPS. Specs for the 512GB model are currently unknown. All three capacities use the 2280 form factor.,The Gigabyte M.2 PCIe SSD clearly demonstrates the company's growing interest in the M.2 storage market. For example, in July, it , that offer extra slots for M.2 PCIe SSDs, so people don't have to break the bank for a motherboard with multiple slots. Between its motherboards, ,, M.2 riser cards and now these SSDs, Gigabyte has created its own portfolio of products for the storage-minded.,Gigabyte didn't share pricing information for its M.2 PCIe SSDs, but you can learn more about the , and , on the company's site."
Toshiba Takes On Optane With 3D XL-Flash: High Performance Meets Low Cost,"Toshiba announced at the Flash Memory Summit that it's developing 3D XL-Flash, which is a high-performance variant of existing flash that purportedly provides a 10X reduction in read latency compared to the TLC flash found in most consumer SSDs. The move comes as a somewhat belated response to Intel's high-performance Optane products that are powered by the exotic, and expensive, ,.,In theory, Toshiba's XL-Flash sounds very similar to ,, which also competes with Intel's Optane. Both new types of NAND offer enough performance to come within striking range of Intel's Optane in the performance measurements that matter, but will come at a much lower price point because they use proven technologies that the companies already produce on a massive scale. Ultimately, that means the new type of flash can undercut Intel's Optane on price by a significant amount, but Toshiba hasn't shared specifics yet.,Speedy Optane memory has come to market as both ,, but high prices have kept the devices, which are significantly faster than normal SSDs, from replacing flash-based SSDs. Currently, Optane retails for roughly $0.60 per GB, but normal flash-based SSDs can dip as low as $0.15 per GB. The 4X price premium might seem reasonable for a superior device, but latency introduced by the drive's controller and firmware, along with the interface and the file system, ultimately reduce much of Optane's performance advantage in real-world applications. That leaves an opening for devices that are cheap and ""good enough."",Toshiba's new flash memory features shorter bitlines and wordlines, which are internal connections to the flash cells, to improve performance. The flash also has more planes, which are independent regions of the flash that can respond to data requests simultaneously, to improve parallelism, and thus performance. XL-Flash is based on Toshiba's tried-and-true BiCS flash, but Toshiba uses the existing flash in SLC mode, meaning it only stores one bit per cell to increase performance.,As a result, XL-Flash provides program times of a mere 7 microseconds, which is much faster than QLC's 30 microsecond program time. Of course, the increased performance comes at the expense of storage density, but Toshiba obviously feels the high performance will offset the die capacity reduction.,At first, Toshiba will use XL-Flash as SLC cache to complement its QLC flash, as a high-performance cache for the larger and cheaper QLC flash devices. Toshiba claims the pair can offer better overall latency than DRAM paired with an HDD storage pool. Much of this advantage is due to XL-Flash's capacity advantage over DRAM, which allows for more cache hits during real-world workloads.,Toshiba will start with SLC-based XL-Flash devices but is considering MLC variants of the high-performance flash as well. The initial products are destined for the data center, but like most high-performance tech, it should filter down to the desktop PC in due course."
"T-Force Brings the Bling With New RGB SSD, DDR4 RAM","T-Force, Team Group's gaming division, has been busy lately developing new products to expand its portfolio. Today, T-Force debuted the Delta R RGB SSD, T-Force Night Hawk RGB Legend and T-Force Xtreem DDR4 memory kits.,The Delta R RGB SSD confines to the standard 2.5-inch form factor with a height of 9.5mm. Available in black or white, the majority of the SSD's stylish body is decked out with RGB lighting accentuated by a built-in water flowing and rainbow effect. Although the default lighting effect cannot be modified, controlled or synchronized by other third-party software, the Delta R RGB SSD still needs to be connected to a standard nine-pin USB header on the motherboard.,Team Group offers the Delta R RGB SSD in three capacities: 250GB, 500GB and 1TB. Constrained by the aging SATA III protocol, the 250GB and 500GB models have a sequential read and write speed of up to 560MB/s and 500MB/s, respectively, and a 4K random read and write speeds that round out at 90,000 IOPS and 80,000 IOPS, respectively. The 1TB model boasts slightly higher speeds with sequential writes in the 510MB/s range and random writes along the lines of 85,000 IOPS. Team Group has kept what's inside a mystery and only cites use of 3D NAND flash.,The Delta R RGB SSD comes with various features, such as support for S.M.A.R.T., TRIM and Error Code Correction (ECC). The SSD is backed by a three-year limited warranty. The 250GB model costs $71.99, and the 500GB model goes for $105.99. Team Group did not reveal pricing for the 1TB model.,In terms of aesthetics, the Night Hawk RGB Legend is practically identical to ,. But since these memory kits are available in gold and with higher frequencies, they earn the Legend monicker. Team Group is bringing two Night Hawk RGB Legend 16GB (2x 8GB) memory kits to the market. The DDR4-3200 kit with CL14-14-14-31 timings costs $250. The DDR4-3466 kit comes with CL16-18-18-38 timings and carries a $230 price tag. Both kits operate at 1.35V.,Lastly, Team Group expanded its T-Force Xtreem DDR4 memory line with two new high-performance 16GB (2x 8GB) memory kits. Both DDR4-4300 and DDR4-4500 memory kits have their timings set at CL18-20-20-44 and run at a whopping 1.45V. The Xtreem DDR4-4300 kit is priced at $325, while the higher-binned Xtreem DDR4-4500 kit will set you back $389."
Intel Optane SSD 905P Bulks Up to 1.5TB,"Intel announced today that it has bumped the Optane SSD 905P's capacity up to 1.5TB, which will come in both U.2 and HHHL (half height, half length) add-in-card (AIC) form factors.,Built around Intel's 3D XPoint memory technology, the , was originally launched in 480GB and 960GB capacities. The 480GB model was confined to the U.2 form factor, and the 960GB model took the form of an AIC. Starting today, consumers can pick up the Optane-powered SSD in three new presentations. The 960GB model is now available in the U.2 format. The new 1.5TB model is available in both the U.2 and HHHL AIC form factors. In fact, we first saw the 1.5TB AIC variant inside the , gaming desktop, so they should be on the market very soon.,Since all Intel Optane SSD 905P drives employ the same internal hardware and communicate with the processor through a,, performance is fairly static across all models no matter the capacity or form factor. Consumers can expect sequential read and write speeds up to 2,700MB/s and 2,200MB/s with 4K random read and write speeds in the range of 575,000 IOPS and 550,000 IOPS. The 480GB model is rated with an endurance of 8.76 PBW (petabytes written), while the 960GB and 1.5TB models have a 17.52 PBW and 27.37 PBW rating, respectively.,The Optane SSD 905P will be making its way to the M.2 form factor in the not-so-distant future. It will initially launch in a 380GB capacity; it's unknown whether Intel will offer them in larger capacities. The chipmaker hasn't listed the technical specifications for the M.2 drive. Nevertheless, we don't expect its performance to be on par with the AIC models, but perhaps more in line with similar M.2 Optane SSDs,Intel didn't reveal the pricing for the new Optane SSD 905P drives. However, Cleveland-based computer hardware retailer , has already listed the SSDs on its website. The Optane SSD 905P 960GB U.2 (SSDPE21D960GAX1) costs $1,415.39. The Optane SSD 905P 1.5TB, in U.2 (SSDPE21D015TAX1) and HHHL AIC (SSDPED1D015TAX1) formats carry even more eye-watering price tags of $2,395.70 each."
WD's My Cloud NAS Drives Have Been Vulnerable Since 2017,"Many people like being able to access their files no matter what device they're using. That's why services like Dropbox, Google Drive, iCloud and OneDrive have become all but ubiquitous. It's also why companies like Western Digital offer connected drives like the My Cloud products, but in that particular case, a security flaw means the person who owns the drive isn't the only one who can access its contents., and , independently found and disclosed a major authentication bypass flaw in My Cloud products in 2017. Vermeulen said he disclosed the problem to Western Digital last April but never received a response from the company. Exploitee.rs also said it contacted Western Digital about the problem last year and even publicly discussed it at Def Con 25, but its warnings also fell on deaf ears.,The flaw in question allows someone to gain administrator access to a My Cloud drive without a password. Vermeulen said that person could ""run commands that would normally require admin privileges and gain complete control of the My Cloud device."" He proved this on a My Cloud model WDBCTL0020HWT running firmware version 2.30.172 but said other models likely bear the same flaw because they use the same code.,Vermeulen and Exploitee.rs both developed proofs of concept demonstrating the flaw in action. It doesn't appear to be particularly difficult--Vermeulen's demo was presented in a GIF--and could probably be exploited by amateurs now that the flaw has been disclosed to the public. Western Digital hasn't developed a fix yet, either, but a year-and-a-half of silence left the researchers little choice but to go public.,We couldn't find public acknowledgement of this vulnerability from Western Digital on its website, blog, or Twitter account. The company has responded directly to some Twitter users, however, and linked to , it quietly published on September 19. In it, the company said that My Cloud Home devices aren't affected and that it plans to address the vulnerability with a firmware update ""within a few weeks."",Western Digital also seemed keen on downplaying its slow response to Vermeulen and Exploitee.rs' disclosures.,""Western Digital works continuously to improve the capability and security of our products, including with the security research community to address issues they may uncover. We encourage responsible disclosure by customers and researchers to ensure our customers are protected while we address valid vulnerabilities,"" it said in its blog post. ,My Cloud device owners are encouraged to enable automatic updates to make sure their devices aren't affected by this flaw as soon as possible."
"Adata's SX7100 SSD Tops 2,100 MB/s (Oh, And There's Another RGB Product, Too)","2,100 MB/s is now the mainstream? Yes, that is the world we live in today. Adata used the massive Computex trade show to announce the SX7100 NVMe SSD. The drive uses the new Realtek RTS5760 DRAM-less controller that supports NVMe 1.3 and Host Memory Buffer (HMB).,HMB technology removes the expensive DRAM chip from the SSD and replaces its function with a small amount of system memory you already have. The result is a lower cost NVMe SSD with almost the same performance as a drive with a local DRAM package used to cache the flash translation layer map.,The new SX7100 replaces the SX7000 in Adata's product stack, but we don't have any pricing or availability details at this time. The SX7000 256GB sells on Amazon for $130 with a five-year warranty. It's not a great value and has largely flown under the radar with Adata's upper tier models, such as the SX8200, getting most of the headlines.,Adata also showed us a prototype RGB, SSD, disk-less, something-or-other. It's called the Tornado and it's the ""World's First RGB PCIe Cooler"".,The only one in the world was in the system running a demo, so we were not able to see what the Tornado was all about. We were told under the cooler was two NVMe and two SATA M.2 drives, but the specification car says one NVMe and one SATA SSD. The disco adapter uses a PCIe 3.0 x4 connector to the host system but we also spotted what looks like a SATA cable attached as well. It's difficult to see the SATA cable because you are mesmerized by the RGB lighting that works with Adata's XPG RGB SYNC App to control the six ""RGB bulbs"".,The fan, which we never did get to see, has five speeds that are user adjustable. There wasn't a lot of substance with this developing product but everything after RGB is just a footnote anyhow in 2018."
Toshiba Ships RC100 'Everybody' NVMe SSD,"Toshiba calls its new RC100 drive an ""Everybody"" NVMe (SSD). The company leveraged its multi-chip package (MCP) technology to fit the SSD controller and flash into a single package. The RC100 is essentially a BGA SSD put on a consumer friendly M.2 2242 board to shave costs.,The DRAM-less design helps cut costs even more by using a small portion of your system memory to handle the flash translation layer map cache. The technology only works over PCI Express, and that's the largest selling point for the RC100, next to the low price. Toshiba's thought process here is that you'll buy the RC100 over a mainstream or premium grade SATA SSD. This isn't a new concept, it's just a new spin on selling an entry-level NVMe drive.,Toshiba brings the RC100 to market in three capacities that range from 120GB to 480GB. Prices fit the intended purpose, starting at just $60 and moving up to $155 ($25 more than a Samsung 860 EVO 500GB).,The performance varies between the three sizes, but the 480GB shows the strongest performance with up to 1,600 MB/s sequential read, and 1,100 MB/s sequential writes. Random performance tops off at 150,000 IOPS read and 110,000 IOPS write thanks to Host Memory Buffer (HMB) technology.,In the coming weeks we hope to publish a full review of the new RC100 to see if it successfully lives up to the promise of outperforming the best SATA SSDs with a nearly equivalent sale price."
Plextor M9Pe Extreme - A Swing And A Miss,"The last Plextor Extreme branded SSD was little more than a firmware tweak that significantly increased performance. The company sold new products under the M5 Extreme name after the update, but owners of the original M5 Pro could download the firmware to get the same performance with identical hardware.,Going into Computex, we saw the same signs coming into focus. The Plextor M9Pe came to market with less performance than we expected. Since the launch day reviews hit the web, the company tweaked the firmware, and the new performance is reminiscent of what we saw in the past. Plextor sent out invitations to see the new Plextor M9Pe Extreme and we expected another firmware upgrade to build a new product.,We were wrong. Instead of taking the easy base hit for a double that would have re-energized the M9Pe with new branding and putting a spotlight on the new 1.04 firmware that makes this a very competitive SSD, the company swung for the fences and missed. The Plextor M9Pe Extreme is an extreme failure. It's still early enough in development to kill the idea without taking a big loss.,The company displayed a Marvell 88NR2241 development board loaded with four M9PeGN M.2 SSDs that use the aging Marvell Eldora NVMe controller. The 88NR2241 is a PCIe 3.0 x8 PCIe bridge chipset that fans to four PCIe 3.0 x4 for M.2 SSDs. There is an obvious bottleneck from the SSD, to the host system but using a bridge removes the bifurcation requirement needed to ensure compatibility with most systems. Existing products like the Asus Hyper M.2 x16 and Asrock Ultra Quad M.2 only work on motherboards with bifurcation like AMD's X399 and Intel's X99/X299 chipsets.,The Marvell 88NR2241 has a place in the market, but not where Plextor wants to use it. In our testing with a single M9Pe running the new 1.04 firmware, we measured random read performance 63.03 MB/s CrystalDisk Mark, the same application Plextor used to show the M9Pe Extreme. Our single drive random write performance result was 175.8 MB/s. The M9Pe Extreme with the data running through the Marvell 88NR2241 bridge shows around 41 MB/s for both, a significant decrease in performance over a single drive.,In our meeting, Plextor stated the new Extreme aims at enthusiasts, workstations users, and potentially the server market. Most of those already run systems based on the X399, X299, and equivalent server chipsets with software NVMe RAID-like Intel's VROC. In our testing, VROC delivers roughly twice the throughput and around 50% more random performance compared to the Plextor M9Pe Extreme Plextor had on display. You can get these benefits with VROC and AMD's interpretation free for RAID 0, whereas the 88NR2241 and add-on board would add to the cost of four M9Pe SSDs."
"MyDigitalSSD Outs 2TB, E12-Bearing BPX Pro","MyDigtialSSD makes products for the working person. The New York-based company is as far away from Silicon Valley's lavishness as you can get. You won't find a parking lot full of exotic cars at the company's office, if you can even find the office at all, because MyDigitalSSD streamlines every aspect of the company to improve efficiency and keep prices low for shoppers.,We've tested branded SSDs from MyDigitalSSD for years, but it was the MyDigitalSSD BPX that put the company on the mainstream map. With the BPX, MyDigitalSSD entered the high-performance market to compete with Adata, Corsair, Patriot, and others. The BPX was the lowest priced Phison PS5007-E7 SSD and it held a massive price gap to products like the Corsair MP500 and Patriot Hellfire M.2. At one point, the BPX 480GB sold for nearly $100 less than similar products. That's why for most of 2017 the MyDigtialSSD BPX was the best value in NVMe storage for many of our readers.,Fast forward to 2018 and MyDigitalSSD is ready to take on the California-based companies again in the Phison E12 era.,""Testing the limits of PCIe 3.1 data transfer, MyDigitalSSD Bullet Proof eXpress (BPX) Pro NVMe SSDs offer Read and Write speeds in excess of 3GB/sec with blistering 4K random speeds. MyDigitalSSD BPX Pro series 2280 M.2 feature the new Phison E12 controller, Toshiba BiCS3 TLC NAND flash, and a NVMe 1.3 interface for improved performance with cooler idle temperatures of 25°C, compared to 45°C from the original BPX. Available in 256GB, 512GB, 1TB, and 2TB storage capacities, BPX Pro 2280 M.2 NVMe will begin shipping this summer with a 5-year limited warranty."" - Matt Dawson, CEO MyDigitalSSD,Dawson wasn't ready to talk pricing, but he did say the BPX Pro will be very competitive. He went on to say the BPX Pro will not only outperform many mainstream NVMe SSDs that cost more, like the Samsung 970 EVO, but will close the gap to ultra-performance models like the Samsung 970 Pro. MyDigitalSSD also sees an opening in the 2TB class after Samsung failed to bring the 970 Pro to market with a 2TB option.,We're excited to see what the company can do this summer with Toshiba's BiCS FLASH. Pricing scales and the numbers are in MyDigitalSSD's favor, and a BPX Pro 2TB could make this capacity a real option for value-driven shoppers."
PNY Next Gen XLR8 CS2080 SSDs Show Strong Performance,"PNY is ready to jump in the ultra-high-performance NVMe SSD market with the CS2080. The new M.2 2280 SSD comes with XLR8 branding, PNY's performance product group for gamers.,Performance is said to reach up to 3,200 MB/s sequential read and up to 3,000 MB/s sequential write speeds for the 1TB model. PNY will also release the CS2080 in 256GB, 512GB, and a massive 2TB drive that is sure to set your heart on fire. The series will ship with a three-year warranty.,The company didn't indicate when the CS2080 will ship, but , in our early testing. We don't expect to see any drives with this controller until August even though some companies would like to reel that into the July time frame.,PNY plans to release the CS2080 add-in card form factor alongside the M.2 2280 models. The mock-up on display at Computex 2018 uses the same CS2080 part number. It had a simple sticker over the controller and Toshiba BiCS FLASH TLC. We hope the company will design a nice heatsink to give it a nice XLR8 look to match some of the company's other aggressive products."
SSD Prices Start To Plunge,"SSD pricing has started to shift over the last few weeks, but there have been signs of an avalanche coming for some time. Several of the largest companies are riding the wave of falling prices by slashing prices on some of their most popular models.,The biggest moves have been from relatively unknown models, such as the OEM Micron 1100, the price of which shifts up and down every day. We spotted the 2TB drive selling for $200 several times as Micron has attempted to blow 1st generation 3D flash models out of the warehouse with steep discounts to make room for newer models with 64-layer memory.,True consumer SSDs sit on shaky ground, too. One model that got our attention before leaving for Computex comes from a brand called Inland Professional. The brand has been around for a number of years and released products in different categories, like in-line surge protectors. It's now a house brand for Micro Center, a popular chain of retail stores known for aggressive CPU and CPU bundle prices.,The Inland Professional 480GB 3D TLC NAND SATA III 6Gb/s 2.5"" Internal Solid State Drive (yes, that is the full name) was the No. 5 best seller on Amazon the day we left for Taipei, priced at just $79. The price has since , but it's also listed on the Micro Center website, where the 240GB model sells for $46, and the 120GB model is a giveaway at just $26.,Now sitting in the fifth slot on the Amazon Best Sellers list is the , (pictured above). The popular drive sells for just $120, but the , is an even better value at $110.,Even industry giant Samsung has reduced prices of new models. The 860 EVO 1TB moved to $248 on Amazon but was available for a few hours on Walmart's website for just $150. The two most popular SSDs on Amazon today are the , and the ,.,NVMe SSDs have yet to ride the avalanche, but we can already feel the tremors. Newegg has the ,, a $50 cut to the MSRP. Samsung cut 970 EVO pricing but not with the same long-blade aggression. The , on Amazon. We expect that price to hold for now, but if models like the SX8200 and HP EX920 gain popularity, Samsung may try to keep pace with the prices.,The market will get even more interesting when ,products appear with 970 Pro-like performance."
Samsung Crams 8TB Into Its Next-Generation PCIe 3.0 x4 SSD," Samsung has corrected its specifications to indicate the drive is not PCIe 4.0. Instead, it is PCIe 3.0 x4.,Samsung has come a long way from the days of exporting dried fish to becoming the industry’s leading solid-state drive manufacturer. The Korean giant’s dominance extends from the conventional SATA 2.5-inch drive to the latest M.2 form factor, but today it revealed an upcoming 8TB NVMe PCIe 3.0 x4 solid-state drive based on the NF1 form factor.,With a heavy focus on enterprise customers and data center, the Samsung 8TB NF1 is by far the company’s largest NVMe solid-state drive to date. It’s quite an achievement that Samsung can stuff eight terabytes of storage onto a printed circuit board that measures 110mm by 30.5mm. Samsung’s new solid-state drive officially belongs to the next-generation small form factor (NGSFF) NF1 category, which will be standardized by the JEDEC Solid State Technology Association in October of this year. In comparison to a M.2 solid-state drive with dimensions of 110mm by 22mm, an NF1 solid-state drive is only 8.5mm wider. However, the added area allows it to feature up to double the capacity of a simple M.2 drive. In its press release, Samsung bragged about how one of its partners installed a total of 72 of the 8TB NF1 drives into a 2U rack to amass up to 576TB of storage space.,Samsung’s secret to producing the 8TB NF1 resides in the company’s 512-gigabyte (GB) NAND packages. The solid-state drive expert soldered 16 of those bad boys to the printed circuit board of the solid-state drive. Each package is comprised of 16 layers of 256 gigabit (Gb) 3-bit V-NAND chips. Unfortunately, Samsung didn’t disclose the exact model of the controller. However, the company previously used one of its Phoenix controllers in past NF1 prototype drives.,On the bright side, Samsung did confirm that 8TB NF1 will employ a brand new high-performance controller that supports the NVM Express 1.3 protocol and a PCI Express 3.0 x4 connection. Therefore, the solid-state drive can deliver sequential read speeds of 3,100 MB/s and write speeds of 2,000 MB/s. It also offers 4KB random read performance up to 500,000 IOPS and 4KB write performance up to 50,000 IOPS. To put the icing on the cake, the 8TB NF1 also sports 12GB of LPDDR4 memory to accelerate data processing and improve energy efficiency. The drive is rated for 1.3 DWPD and backed by a three-year warranty."
Working PCIe 4.0 Spotted In The Wild As 5.0 Approaches,"PC users will have to wait a little longer for PCI Express 4.0 but IBM has the technology ready to ship. We spotted a Wistron P93D2-2P server code named MiHawk at the Adata booth. The server features PCIe 4.0 with up to 64GB/s to the storage backplane from a Microsemi HBA. 16 SATA/SAS and 8 U.2 NVMe SSD ports divide the bandwidth, a 2x increase from a single PCIe 3.0 x16 HBA. ,Wistron calls the MiHawk the ""1st PCIe Gen 4 to enhance the I/O Data Rate"". The IBM Power9 (LaGrange) processor features 4 threads per core and a massive 120MB L3 cache. The technology uses up to 8 memory channels and supports up to 4TB of system memory. Sadly, it will not play Crysis. The IBM POWER9 server runs on Linux, Ubuntu, CentOS, or SLES. Windows users will just have to wait for AMD or Intel to bring us the high-bandwidth next generation interconnect sometime in 2019. ,The server on display didn't have any components inside; it's a barebones display that didn't even have the PCIe 4.0 Microsemi HBA cards installed. The big take away is that PCIe 4.0 was finalized in October 2017 and some companies have designs ready to ship.,While at Computex we learned from PCI-SIG that PCIe 5.0 has moved to 0.7. The 0.7 revision is just one step away from the final release slated for 2019. PCI-SIG has said in the past that PCIe 4.0 will be short lived due to the quick turn around for 5.0 that again doubles bandwidth. It's possible for PC makers to ignore 4.0 and focus resources on implementing 32GT/s per lane in products coming to market in 2020.,The server was used as the backdrop for the new Adata SR2000 enterprise SSD. The SR2000 ships in two form factors, the 2.5"" U.2 shown here and the superior add-in card form factor. Both use enterprise-grade 3D TLC memory but the add-in card scales up to 11TB, 6GB/s performance, and up to 1 million IOPS The U.2 model also scales to 11TB but sequential performance drops to ""just"" 3,500 MB/s and 830,000 IOPS random performance."
Galax Hall Of Fame NVMe SSD With Phison E12 Spotted,"Galax had several SSDs on display at Computex, but the company doesn't export them to the U.S. or Europe, so most go unnoticed. There was one product that we couldn't stay away from. In 2017 Galax was the first company to build a 1TB SSD based on the Phison E7 controller using MLC flash. As far as we can tell only one made it out of China and ,.,Galax Hall Of Fame SSDs are expensive and built in very limited numbers, but they are also very attractive. The company plans to release a new Hall of Fame add-in card SSD using the new Phison PS5012-E12 controller, and we saw it at Computex 2018.,The drive was glued to an acrylic sheet for security so we didn't get to see the cooler design. In our testing with the previous generation we found the design ineffective from a functional stand point, but we would still buy it for the looks. Seriously, just look at it!,The new model based on the Phison E12 controller adds an RGB element but we didn't get to see the drive in action. The company only had one on display and it wasn't powered on. The E12-based Hall of Fame should be faster than the previous generation. We published some , last week. The Hall of Fame heatsink under the brilliant white cover should increase performance over time during heavy workloads by keeping the controller from thermal throttling.,We can only hope for the opportunity to test this drive when it ships later this year. We expect the Hall of Fame E12 to carry a retail price close to $1,000 and ship in very limited numbers like the previous generation."

SD Cards To Support Up To 128TB And 985 MB/s With NVMe and PCIe Interfaces,"Soon you will be able to purchase new SD cards with the SD Version 7.0 specification. The new specification supports up to 985MB/s of throughput, which comes courtesy of PCIe and NVMe interfaces, and up to 128TB of capacity. That's quite the jump over the current 2TB limit.,985MB/s of throughput for a simple SD card may seem ludicrous, but higher-resolution video, VR, automotive use-cases, and IoT applications are steadily encroaching upon the performance limits of today's products. ,OEMs are notoriously slow to adopt radically new designs, so the new SD Express specification is also backward compatible with the legacy UHS-I interface. Backward compatibility means we will see end devices come to market faster, whereas other faster interfaces have withered on the vine due to reworked interfaces that prevent broad uptake.,The specification has reserved space for new pins for future use, so it also provides room for forward progress (,). The specification also accommodates up to 1.8W of power consumption, which will help boost performance. The NVMe 1.3 protocol also brings several new features to SD cards, like Host Memory Buffer (HMB), which sets aside a small portion of system memory to boost performance, and Multi-Queue support, which improves performance during simultaneous file transfers.,The SD association will bring the interface to SDHX, SDXC, and SDUC cards first, but it also plans to bring the speedy connection to MicroSD cards in the future. The first cards wielding the improved interface should come to market in 2019."
Fujitsu Targets 2019 for NRAM Mass Production,"Having acquired the license to produce , (Nano-RAM) back in 2016, Fujitsu finally put the pedal to the medal to begin mass production next year.,While other companies are fighting over modern non-volatile memory solutions such as 3D XPoint or NVDIMM, Japanese giant Fujitsu has its eye set on NRAM instead. Developed by U.S.-based nanotechnology company Nantero Inc., NRAM is a next-generation non-volatile RAM solution, whose ambition is to replace the traditional DRAM employed in memory and storage products. Nantero's NRAM is built from the bottom up with carbon nanotubes that are 50 times stronger than steel, half the density of aluminum, and 1/50,000th the diameter of a human hair.,NRAM technology promises faster write speeds, higher densities, and lower power consumption at a lower cost than current non-volatile memory solutions on the market. And not only that – NRAM also has a high level of heat tolerance and endurance, making it a perfect fit for the enterprise, automotive, military, scientific, and industrial sectors. Initial tests have shown that NRAM can operate without a hitch at 200°C. However, the specifications claim that NRAM can cope with temperatures up to 800°C as well as store data for more than 1,000 years at 85°C and more than 10 years at 300°C.,Fujitsu's NRAM-embedded custom LSI product is currently in the development phase. However, the company expects it to come out of the oven by the end of this year, and it will continue to expand its product lineup with standalone NRAM products. The Japanese manufacturer has confirmed that it will produce its first generation of NRAM products under its proprietary 55nm manufacturing process.,As it is with all new technology, the adoption process will be a gradual and long-term affair. However, big names such as Dell, Cisco, Kingston, and CFT Capital have recently joined Nantero's cause. Therefore, there is hope that Nanatero's NRAM makes its way into consumer products in the not-so-distant future. "
Seagate Grows BarraCuda Family With New SSD,"Storage specialist Seagate is venturing into the highly competitive solid-state drive (SSD) market with its new 2.5-inch BarraCuda, featuring ample storage up to 2TB in capacity.,Seagate, one of the more-established storage manufacturers in the hard drive industry, is looking to gain ground in the SSD segment with the upcoming consumer offering. The 2.5-inch form factor SSD drive is 7 millimeters thick and employs a standard SATA III connector. Seagate offers the BarraCuda SSD in in four capacities: 250GB, 500GB, 1TB, and 2TB. According to the manufacturer, the BarraCuda SSD delivers sequential read and write speeds of 540 MB/s and 520 MB/s. It's also equipped with a special flash-speed function that boosts its performance up to 560 MB/s and 90,000 IOPS. Although Seagate didn't reveal any information on the SSD's power consumption, the company did confirm that it comes with an ultra-low power mode to reduce power consumption.,Reliability is one of the BarraCuda SSD's strongest traits. It carries a MTBF (mean time between failures) rating of 1.8 million hours and boasts an impressive endurance up to 1092 TBW (terabytes written). Seagate backs all its BarraCuda SSDs with a generous five-year warranty that includes 24-hour global technical support.,The BarraCuda SSDs will make their debut on ,, which kicks of on July 16 at 3 p.m. Eastern Time. General availability will come later this year around September. Amazon has already revealed pricing for a few of the BarraCuda SSDs. The 250GB, 500GB, and 1TB models cost $79.99, $129.99, and $249.99, respectively. With current discounts, you can purchase the 250GB model for $74.99, the 500GB model for $119.99 and the 1TB model for $229.99. Although Amazon didn't list the spacious 2TB model, we expect it to be priced at around $449.99."
Samsung Starts Mass Producing 96-Layer 256Gb V-NAND Memory Chips,"Top NAND manufacturer Samsung announced that it has commenced mass production of its fifth-generation V-NAND memory chips.,There is an increasing need in the market for bigger and faster storage devices, and as the saying goes, “the early bird catches the worm.” Samsung plans to stay ahead of the game with its latest 96-layer 256Gb V-NAND memory chips, which will raise the bar for 3D NAND flash memory.,Samsung's fifth-generation V-NAND memory chips are the first in the industry to exploit the 'Toggle DDR 4.0' interface that acts as a high-speed highway for data to travel up to a speed of 1.4 Gbps between storage and memory. This is a 40% increase over the company's previous 64-layer V-NAND offering. Other performance enhancements include reduction of the data write speed to 500μs, a 30% improvement over its previous generation of V-NAND memory chips, and the response time to read-signals to 50μs. However, the increase in performance is merely the tip of the iceberg. The new 96-layer V-NAND memory chips are also more energy-efficient, boasting an operating voltage of 1.2V as opposed to the previous 64-layer chip's 1.8V.,In order to achieve all the aforementioned improvements, Samsung stacked more than 90 layers of 3D charge trap flash (CTF) cells in the form of a pyramid into the fifth-generation V-NAND memory chip. Each layer features microscopic channel holes that are invisible to the human eye. Nevertheless, the channel holes contain over 85 billion CTF cells capable of storing up to three bits of data each. This method of fabrication is the product of many amazing breakthroughs, including advanced circuit designs and new process technologies. Samsung didn't dwell into specifics, but the company claims that the enhancements in the V-NAND’s atomic layer deposition process has allowed it to increase manufacturing productivity by over 30% and reduce the height of each cell by 20%.,Samsung plans to bring its 96-layer V-NAND memory chips to the markets as soon as possible. The company will initially release them in the 256Gb TLC (three bits per cell) flavor with a larger 1Tb QLC (four bits per cell) chip coming further down the road."
"96-Layer, QLC, SLC... Maxio Shows Off All The New Flash And A Couple Controllers","We aren't sure which new flash memory we're more excited about, but it's really cool that Maxio Technology lined them all up for us with the same controller to evaluate each technology's performance at Computex 2018.,Before we dive into the light testing, let's talk about the Maxio MAS0902 SATA DRAMless controller. The controller's design supports up to 2TB of planar and 3D flash memory (but you will see it running 4TB of QLC in the charts). It features Maxio's proprietary technologies, such as AgileECC 2 (2nd gen ECC), WriteBooster 2 (2nd gen SLC write buffer), DEVSLP (low-power mode), power and thermal throttling, and end-to-end data protection. The controller also supports both TCG-Opal 2.0 and Microsoft's eDrive (IEEE1667) full disk data encryption.,The MAS0902 is the successor to Maxio's MAS0802 DRAMless controller, which shipped in a handful of very low-cost SSDs, with the most recognized brands being Adata, Apacer, and Transcend.,The Maxio suite featured a table lined with reference design boards using emerging flash memory technology. Currently, Toshiba's BiCS3 and Micron/Intel's 64-layer dominate the new production SSDs shipping today in the consumer space. Samsung uses its own 64-layer memory but it's rare to see it in a consumer SSD not branded by Samsung. ,Of the dominant memory shipping today, only the Toshiba BiCS3 (64-layer TLC) was available to make our comparison graphs using the same Maxio MAS0902 DRAMless controller. The other reference design boards use SK Hynix 4th generation TLC at 64-layers, Intel's N18A QLC, UNIC 32-layer 3D TLC, Spectek 3D SLC M16A, and Micron 96-layer TLC.,The test uses a queue depth of 32 for the sequential read and write tests and invalidates both for any useful comparative analysis. You can read why ,.,The two Intel QLC SSDs have a large capacity advantage, but that doesn't play a significant role in the QD1 random tests, because this workload only addresses the drive in such a way that one die is active at a time. QLC random reads are not the dominant new memory for the optimal user experience, although initial 4-corner testing shows the technology in a strong position. The Micron 96-layer TLC also looks strong. All three drives using Micron and Intel flash feature a high-speed data bus that decreases the latency for the transaction. We also see this in drives shipping today with second generation 3D memory from both companies.,Maxio plans to introduce two new low-cost NVMe controllers to the market before the end of 2018. The MAP0902 DRAMless and MAP0901 with a DRAM buffer both look like promising designs and feature the company's proprietary technologies. We will learn more about the new NVMe products at Flash Memory Summit in August."
ASolid Creates SSD Confusion By Using Similar Model Number To Competitors,"We're not fans of companies borrowing part numbers from their competitors. It creates confusion in the market, and even worse, it just shows a lack of innovation when a company can't even piece together a unique product number.,For the last two years, Silicon Motion, Inc. has shipped the SM2258 4-channel SATA SSD controller. In that time we've come to call this part the ""2258"". It's a simple, and precise, abbreviation that everyone reading a SSD review knows and understands. It's a popular controller, and now there are two 2258 controllers.,ASolid jumped into the market with the AS2258 2-channel SATA controller that, on paper, shows similar specifications, features, and component support as its SMI counterpart.,The AS2258 ships in products destined mainly for mainland China, where low-cost SSDs are big sellers. To reach insanely low prices some off-brands ""reclaim"" flash from broken devices like SSDs that have been returned for replacement. That sounds bad on its own, but those are a product tier higher than counterfeit SSDs, which ship in the millions.,We're not claiming ASolid or its partners have done anything that nefarious, they just took the 2258 name and made it their own. It's really too bad the company chose to go down this road. The performance of the AS2258 is pretty good for a low-cost SSD. The sequential performance looks good. We did notice a lack of high random read performance with the AS2258, however, which is what makes the SM2258 such a good controller for consumer workloads."
Gigabyte M.2 PCIe Riser Cards Take Storage Performance to New Level,"Gigabyte has introduced the CMT4034 and CMT4032 M.2 PCI-Express (PCIe) riser cards for consumers who need the utmost storage performance.,M.2 solid-state drives (SSDs) are getting bigger and faster by the day. There is no denying that the M.2 form factor is the future for data storage. Unfortunately, the majority of modern motherboards only come with a single M.2 slot unless you start shopping in the really high-end section. And most budget-conscious consumers won't pay a heavy premium for an extra M.2 slot. That's where Gigabyte's CMT403x series M.2 PCIe riser cards come into play. The add-in cards allow users to use multiple M.2 SSDs with the PCIe protocol in their systems as long as there is a PCIe 3.0 x8 or x16 lane available on the ,. Since the both the CMT4034 and the CMT4032 lack the PCIe switching feature, the motherboard needs to support the PCIe bifurcation functionality.,The CMT403x series M.2 PCIe riser cards, with dimensions of 150 millimeters x 68.9 millimeters, respect the low-profile form factor. Nevertheless, they come with both a low-profile and full-height I/O brackets to virtually fit into any system. The riser cards possess a blue PCB complemented by a metallic black heatsink with the Gigabyte branding to provide cooling for the M.2 SSDs.,The CMT4032 accomodates up to two PCIe 3.0 x4 SSDs with the 2280 or 22110 form factors. This riser card is made up of a single PCB with two M.2 M-Key slots. The CMT4032 requires a free PCIe 3.0 x8 lane to work properly.,Gigabyte also offers the CMT4034 for hardcore enthusiasts and prosumers who want to max out their systems' storage performance. The CMT4034 houses up to four PCIe 3.0 x4 SSDs, thanks to its dual-PCB design. Two M.2 M-Key slots are placed on each side of the primary PCB, while the secondary PCB is responsible for communicating with the PCIe 3.0 x16 lane on the motherboard.,At the time of this article, Gigabyte hasn't revealed the pricing and availability for the CMT4032 and CMT4034 M.2 PCIe riser cards."
Intel's Limited Edition Core i7-8086K Is On Sale,"If you didn't win one of the ,, it's time to make other plans. In the U.S. that means ,, ,or Micro Center for most. The first two have processors in stock as of today, both selling for around $425, or $25 less than the MSRP.,For those still in Taipei you can take your pick from two stores in the old computer mall with pricing starting around 14300NT (around $479) plus a 2% credit card fee. Just look for the glass display of retail boxed CPUs on the second floor for the better deal.,""The 8086 ""sweepstakes"" will be open to residents of the U.S., China, Germany, Canada, France, the UK, South Korea, Taiwan, and Japan. Each of those countries have 500 up for grabs, except Germany, China, and the U.S., which will have considerably more processors to give away (1,000, 2,000 and 2,086 respectively)."",Rumor has it that , with the first 8086 handed out through the sweepstakes that covers nine countries. The first processor with a factory set 5GHz turbo clock feeding frenzy has already started. Good luck getting your orders in."
JMicron Has A 10Gb/s USB 3 To NVMe Bridge Adapter,"Just days before hopping on the plane for Computex 2018 one of our readers asked about a USB to NVMe adapter. We thought, no one would make that. Why would anyone release that product with all of the Thunderbolt 3 drives coming out with a large bandwidth advantage?,JMicron proved us wrong. Apparently, there are a lot of people who want a USB to PCIe bridge chip for storage to take full advantage of the 10Gb/s bus bandwidth without using two SATA drives in RAID 0. The final product will be smaller, lighter, and more robust that what companies currently ship.,The combination also delivers higher performance without any complicated setup, options, or configuration needed to get the most out of the drive. Testing in the JMicron suite with the reference design adapter paired with a Samsung 970 Pro produced excellent results. The performance we observed would easily put this drive at the top of our portable USB SSD performance charts.,JMicron also gave us a quick look at performance with other SSDs like the Intel 900P using Optane memory, and popular low-cost models like the Western Digital Black 3D NVMe. The sequential performance was limited by the chipset and bus, but they all worked. The point wasn't to show the performance, it was to show how diverse the bridge chip is with other products.,It doesn't take a full PCIe 3.0 x4 SSD to saturate the bus. If a company were to release a DIY standalone enclosure without a drive installed, a MyDigitalSSD SBX or similar low-cost NVMe SSD with a PCIe 3.0 x2 interface would still leverage the full 10Gb/s bandwidth available.,The next goal is to turn the reference design into a shipping product. The company also brought along a proposed design from a company called Axisplus based in Taiwan. Axisplus will release the AP-583 before the end of the year in select markets. The design uses an all-aluminum housing with an unknown SSD inside from the factory. Capacities range from 240GB to 960GB, but we didn't learn anything on pricing or availability.,We have a reference design board in our travel bag for testing in the near future. It will be interesting to see how the JMicron reference design compares to products like the , that uses Thunderbolt 3."
Klevv Is Working To Finalize The First RGB M.2 NVMe SSD,"Klevv is preparing an RGB M.2 NVMe SSD based on the Silicon Motion SM2263 architecture called the CRAS X RGB. The 4-channel drive uses a PCIe 3.0 x4 host interface with assistance from a DRAM buffer (the SM2263XT is the DRAMless version). The heatsink on the display drive was not finalized, but a representative told us to expect something very similar with defused lighting.,The architecture doesn't matter too much; the big draw here is the RGB LED feature. Klevv is working on a solution to address the disco lighting. The PCIe bus and NVMe protocol are quite different from USB and system memory, so a new software suite will need to communicate commands to the drive. NVMe was designed to streamline commands to reduce latency, so there is very little to play with to make the drive addressable RGB, and Klevv is determined to build RGB communication to the controller without attaching a cable and header to an already cable-less drive.,Klevv also designed matching system memory coming to market under the CRAS X RGB name. This memory supports the Asus Aura Sync, Gigabyte Fusion, and MSI Mystic Light software. The clock speed and timings are not known at this time but the demo showed up to 45,663 MB/s read and 52,370 MB/s write speed--much faster than the SSD reading 1,752 MB/s and writing 1,486 MB/s with 128KB sequential data."
Patriot Readies Viper SSDs With Phison E12 And S12,"Patriot said at Computex 2018 that it's preparing two new SSDs, the Viper M.2 SSD and an S12 SATA SSD, to round out its 2018 product line.,The Viper M.2 SSD packs up to 1TB of NVMe high-speed storage on a slim 2280 form factor with up to 3,200 MB/s read and 3,000 MB/s write speeds using sequential data. The random performance will peak at 600,000 IOPS, enough to satisfy any gamer, the line's target audience. We've already briefly experienced , and shared our early thoughts.,What Patriot adds to the story is just how close the Viper M.2 is to market. The company plans to ship the drive in 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB sizes in the next 30 days and hopes to sweep others with similar products as well as those based on Silicon Motion's SM2262EN coming later in the year. We didn't hear anything about retail pricing from the company, but don't expect this SSD to break the bank.,The successor to Phison's successful and diverse S10 SATA controller, which played dual roles as high-performance beast with MLC flash and low-cost general use SSD with TLC, is closer to reality. The Phison S12 will play a similar role with support for both 3D TLC and QLC making it a potent weapon in any SSD manufacturer's arsenal.,Patriot displayed the first retail S12 SATA SSD at Computex 2018 but says this model will only come after the Viper M.2 ships. With performance limited by the SATA bus at roughly 550 MB/s, we feel this drive is best suited for legacy system upgrades not compatible with NVMe and lower cost mainstream builds pieced together with a focus on maximizing the best bang for the buck."
UNIC And Maxiotek Brought China's 32-Layer 3D TLC To Computex,"China has tired of semiconductor ebb and flow, just like the rest of us, but unlike us the country actually has the power to do something about it. It's ready to pounce on DRAM makers Micron, Samsung, and SK Hynix for an alleged price fixing scheme, and that breaking story will play out for years to come. When the dust settles the companies will likely pay a fine, take a slap on the wrist, and promise never to get caught doing it again, just like in the mid 2000s.,This game plays out every few decades, but China may have figured out a way to stop it from happening again. Instead of sitting idle, the country has invested billions of dollars in DRAM and NAND flash development. The dollars cover every aspect of the product, from IP to R&D and now manufacturing.,China and its partners are not trying to develop the most innovative products. To start they just need to produce ""good enough"" technology to disrupt pricing, guarantee availability, and prepare to use it in millions of mostly low-cost devices. For instance, during the NAND flash shortage, companies without guaranteed access to flash would ""reclaim"" memory from broken devices and produce ""new"" SSDs that sold for half the price of SSDs in the U.S. and Europe. That's not an ideal solution, but it worked in the short term to meet demand.,Today we saw UNIC's 32-layer 3D TLC memory in action for the first time. Maxiotek paired the new memory with a MAS0902 controller and the results are much better than we expected.,This combination will not play a significant role in the coming months, but UNIC has aggressive plans to scale density by ramping to 64-layers rapidly. The government-subsidized company will ship most products inside The Great Wall, but the ripples will spread around the globe, likely taking the form of lower prices once manufacturing takes off with a viable product.,We will have more coverage from the Maxiotek booth later this week with a detailed breakdown of the new controllers and performance comparisons of 96-layer TLC and QLC technology."
Intel Optane Memory Plus Low-Cost NVMe QLC Will Rock The Boat,"Here at Computex 2018 we've spoken to numerous companies about emerging storage technologies, seen the road maps, and ,. One key takeaway from the show has been just how cheap SSDs will become. Walmart recently dropped the price of Samsung's 860 EVO 1TB to $150 for a few hours before adjusting it to $250, a $50 drop from the day before. Then came , in the form of 32-layer TLC at the Maxiotek booth. Still, no matter how cheap storage gets, it's hard to compete with ""free."",That's exactly how Intel plans to establish its new storage products. Some companies have already bundled Intel's Optane Memory with their motherboards to increase awareness about the technology. Early reports appear positive in user reviews as ,. And this is just the first step designed to remove hard disk drives, and their latency, from the user experience altogether.,The next shoe to drop could involve adding QLC-based SSDs to a bundle with next generation chipset components that allow Optane Memory to cache NVMe devices. The rumored , for this to bear fruit. The leaked deck shows capacities between 512GB and 2TB but QLC, will need a nudge to gain acceptance due to reliability and endurance concerns.,Sitting behind high-endurance Optane Memory (cache) will remove any immediate concerns regarding QLC's endurance. A bundle that gives users a free or very low cost 512GB boot drive will be difficult to pass over even for the most adamant Optane and QLC naysayers.,We've asked Intel several times about using Optane Memory in front of very low cost SSDs to increase system performance and received the same ""no comment"" answer as we get with any rumor fact checking subject. The difference in this case is the inability to hide the ear-to-ear grin that inadvertently tells us that has been the plan for Optane Memory all along."
Intel Shows Off Its 380GB 905P Optane M.2 SSD At Computex,"Intel announced and then demonstrated at Computex 2018 the awesome power of a 380GB Optane SSD 905P in a M.2 22110 (22mm wide, 110mm long) form factor that will come to market before the end of the year. The announcement was light on details, but we've , prior to the 905P add-in card launch.,To demonstrate the new SSD's capabilities, Intel showed two systems side-by-side while they encoded the same video. One system utilized the Optane SSD 905P while the other used a ,. It's difficult to see in the picture we snapped from the event, but the Optane SSD fed the CPU data fast enough to utilize 82% and the GPU (also used to process data) 86%. The SSD 760p with flash memory and a Silicon Motion, Inc. SM2262 controller only allowed the CPU to utilize 13% and the GPU 17%.,We're not able to give you the rendering time for the high resolution 40 second 4K video clip because Intel shut the display down before the 760p finished. The Optane system took just 17 seconds to finish; the 760p system was slightly less than halfway through the workload.,On stage, an Intel representative said the 905P M.2 SSD would ship before the end of the year. We suspect the company will aim for the Flash Memory Summit time frame in August, but then again, we could have these drives in our hands before the end of the month. Intel has been very aggressive with Optane Technology, more so than we ever expected. The 900P, 905P, Optane Memory, and 800P M.2 SSDs hit the scene like a landslide. We hope the company also builds a smaller, more affordable drive that fills the gap between the 118GB 800P and 280GB 900P that currently sells for around $370.,Regardless of when it debuts, if you are a performance enthusiast, this is the storage technology you want in your system.

First Look: Phison's E12 NVMe SSD Controller Performance Impresses,"Phison's PS5012-E12 is one of two controllers we expect to see a lot of at Computex 2018. Its high-performance 8-channel design is the successor to the PS5007-E7 that took the market by storm in 2017, due to its aggressive pricing and MLC flash.,The E12 leverages Phison's IP to usher in a new era. Its design works with both 3-bit per cell TLC and upcoming 4-bit per cell QLC memory technology.,“The PS5012-E12 is our 2nd Generation PCIe Gen3x4 NVMe flagship controller,” said KS Pua, Chairman and CEO of Phison.  “We incorporated our latest and greatest engineering technologies, from the CoXprocessor 2.0, LDPC 3.0 and our DSP (Digital Signal Processor) 2.0.  It will enable our partners to provide the most suitable PCIe SSD to the gamers and PC enthusiasts who seek the highest-performing systems. This is, without a doubt, Phison’s best SSD controller to date.”,We received our sample, loaded with the same firmware companies will show at Computex, just prior to leaving for the country of humidity, sweat, and delightfully cheap imported Wagyu steak. With little time to spare, we went right to work running tests to get the first half of the evolving E12 story.,As mentioned, we're testing with the latest firmware on a reference-design drive. The firmware will change when products ship later this year, but Phison tells us the performance with this firmware will be very close to the retail products'.,We observed some odd behavior in the synthetic tests, but that's very common before the final polish to the code. For instance, the sequential read performance at queue depth (QD) 2 and 4 is lower than at QD1.,We hope Phison and partners don't touch the massive sequential write performance. Even with the early firmware, our sample blasted past the high results set by the Samsung 970 series, including the workstation-class Pro model.,Phison tells us the new E12 is capable of up to 600,000 random read and write IOPS. We didn't quite get that high with our test system, but did observe excellent random performance. The E12's mixed-workload performance saw a massive increase over the previous generation.,Moving over to real world applications. The Phison E12 reference design easily breaks into the top 5 NAND-based SSD list that we often use to compare against other products in this class. ,With a heavy Office and Adobe workload--and two games mixed in for good measure--the E12 again breaks into the top 5 here, with an average throughput score of 626 MB/s. This is close to 60 MB/s faster than the , using Toshiba's 15nm planar MLC memory and the previous-generation Phison 8-channel controller.,Over the coming days we will meet with Phison's partners and learn more about product releases and, hopefully, pricing. Patriot was the first to display a retail PS5012-E12 SSD back in January at CES but stated its Viper NVMe SSD would come in the second half of the year. Early rumors from the show lead us to believe we'll see E12-based SSDs as early as July or August.,While it's too early at this moment to say for sure, we're hopeful that this controller will help usher in yet another era of faster, affordable SSDs. If that indeed happens, and graphics card pricing continues to retreat, this summer could be a very good time to build or upgrade a new PC."
"Intel Announces Optane DC Persistent Memory Is Sampling Now, With Broad Availability In 2019","Intel took to the stage at its Memory and Storage day to announce the new Intel Optane DC persistent memory. The company said this new persistent memory ""represents a new class of memory and storage technology architected specifically for data center usage,"" with the express purpose of supporting the massive amounts of storage that data centers require with the industry's ever-increasing need for speed.,How's it supposed to accomplish that goal? Well, by offering more capacity than traditional DRAM per module, with the first products being available in three SKUs with 128, 256, and 512GB capacities. That's significantly more than the highest DDR4 stick offers--Crucial previously held that crown with a 128GB capacity product that cost $4,000 per stick. By contrast, Intel Optane DC is supposed to ""offer the unprecedented combination of high-capacity, affordability, and persistence,"" so we're guessing the first products won't run customers upwards of $4,000 a pop.,Here's what Intel's vice president and general manager of Xeon products and data center marketing, Lisa Spelman, said in a press release:,""High-capacity persistent memory in the data center allows applications to run without incurring the latency penalty of going out to storage over the PCIe bus. As developers adapt software, this new memory class is designed to enable cost-effective, large-capacity in-memory database solutions; provide greater system uptime and faster recovery after power cycles; accelerate virtual machine storage; deliver higher performance to multi-node, distributed cloud applications; and offer advanced encryption for persistent data built into the hardware."",We first learned about an Optane DIMM package in 2016 ,. The technology didn't arrive in the expected timeframe, which led us to question if endurance would be an issue with 3D XPoint products, and in November 2016 we also heard that power and thermal requirements ,. Then, in February, Lenovo , about the DIMMs' launch than intended.,Now we know that Intel's sampling the new Optane DC persistent memory and that the products will ship for revenue to ""select customers"" at some point this year, with broad availability beginning sometime in 2019. Developers won't have to wait to get their hands on the tech, though, because Intel plans to offer remote access Intel Optane DC persistent memory-equipped systems via the Intel Builders Construction Zone.,Intel's hope is that developers will take quickly to the new persistent memory products. Spelman said in the press release:,""As technologies like Intel Optane DC persistent memory come to market, systems architects and developers should consider new methods for data access and storage, and uncover opportunities to remove throughput bottlenecks. These new methods could also result in deriving more value from data.  The combination of Intel Optane DC persistent memory with our performance-optimized Intel Optane SSDs and next-generation cost-optimized 3D NAND SSDs with Quad-Level Cell (QLC) technology will further deliver storage efficiency to warm data as an alternative to relying on HDDs."""
SSD Trends To Look For At Computex 2018,"Computex is a frenzy of storage-related news, and consumer SSDs lead the charge. We've identified what to look for when the show kicks off, and even break some news to set the tone for Computex 2018.,Low flash memory prices allow more companies to jump in the SSD market, so we expect more announcements than Computex 2017. Just last week ,. Companies that dabble in the technology and got out when flash was expensive will return with ""me too"" products that help push pricing down further. Look for these companies to add lighting, extravagant heat sinks, and other accessories to grab our attention. Only some of the SSDs will actually ship, but it's always fun to see what companies are capable of producing in limited numbers.,Most of the specific products are under embargo until June 5, but we have the major bullet points for you today. We'll start with the controllers and then move through some trends that will carry over into 2019.,The Silicon Motion SM2262 began to impact the SSD market soon after CES. Intel, HP, and Adata all ship at least one SSD with the controller to the US and Europe markets, and several Chinese companies also sell drives with this controller in that region. At Computex, we will see more companies with SM2262 drives ready for the masses with retail availability raining down through the rest of 2018.,Silicon Motion first displayed the SM2262EN at Computex last year, but it wasn't a working sample. The flagship controller delivers even more performance than the SM2262. We'll learn more at the show about retail products, the release cycle, and performance.,We recently began testing a reference 1TB E12 SSD in our lab and the initial performance looks promising. Within minutes, we hit 3,200 MB/s with both sequential read and write tests. The read performance is roughly 300 MB/s shy of the latest 1TB Samsung 970 Pro, but the E12 scored 500 MB/s more than the 970 Pro in sequential writes.,The PCMark 8 Storage Test results also look promising (image).,Patriot was the first to show a retail E12 SSD back in January at CES. We expect to see more products like the Patriot Viper as companies start to build a buzz for new models coming later in the year.,We were one of the first sites to ,. That's not always a good thing. Since our review, Plextor has quietly released three firmware updates that improved performance. We mentioned this was a possibility in our review and pointed back to previous products from the company that progressed down the same path.,Just days ago Plextor sent media an email blast to look out for the new M9Pe Extreme. For now, that's all we know about the Marvell Eldora-based SSD. If history repeats itself, this may be a new release that existing M9Pe owners will benefit from. Either way, if you own the M9Pe, head over to Plextor's site and download the new firmware to get a nice performance bump. We hope to write a new review soon that covers the M9Pe SSD with the new 1.04 firmware installed.,Did you know that Realtek makes SSD controllers? The company best known for embedded audio on motherboards has shipped a few different SSD controllers over the years. Most of the SSDs outfitted with the controllers come from Colorful, a company best known for graphics cards. Adata also built a consumer SSD based on the Realtek controller, but it went largely unnoticed in the US and Europe.,We , at Flash Memory Summit. The Microsemi room had a board used to test and develop the new flash. Toshiba and manufacturing partner Western Digital have made progress with QLC, and Micron and Intel have also made news recently. Micron announced the 7,680GB 5210 ION enterprise SATA SSD, but it is rated for less than one drive write per day.,We learned that some SSD manufacturers would display working QLC prototypes at Computex 2018. By the end of the show, we should know more about the performance, endurance, and possible capacities of the models slated for 2019.,There is a chance we'll see 96-layer TLC this year. If it doesn't appear at Computex, we should get our first look at Flash Memory Summit in August.,Flash has hit its peak and is on a downward price swing due to oversupply, but DRAM pricing is still on the rise with no limit in sight. Most consumer SSDs still ship with DDR3, but with production lines shifting to newer DDR4, the rest of the industry has to follow the tide. DDR4 increases the data throughput between the memory and the controller, and it also lowers overall power consumption. To get around the rising costs of DDR4, some companies are looking at LPDDR4 that doesn't carry the price premium that low power DRAM usually does.,The M.2 specification is very diverse. So far, most consumers SSDs use the M.2 2280 (22mm wide, 80mm long) form factor. That will soon change as manufacturers start to shave costs to be more competitive in a buyers' market. We expect to see more drives on display in the 2260 and 2242 form factors. Most of these products will fall into the entry-level NVMe SSD class, but they will help the industry transition away from SATA SSDs.,We expect to see more flash-based portable storage products at the show. These will come in different forms, from exotic, like the new Silicon Power Bolt B80 shown above, to tame plastic models designed to go in your backpack.,Analysts predict NVMe will out-ship SATA for the first time in 2018. SATA has reached its performance peak and largely fallen to the wayside for enthusiasts, at least in primary storage roles. SATA will live on for years to come, but we will see these drives transition to secondary storage and for ""legacy system upgrades"". Other than a few new RGB gimmick SSDs, we don't expect to see anything exciting from the SATA camp at Computex 2018. "
Marvell Announces Two New NVMe Controllers,"Marvell announced two new NVMe controllers that will emerge in retail SSDs around the 2019 time frame. The 8-channel 88SS1100 and 4-channel 88SS1084 enable INFi4.0 and Toggle 3 flash memory technology for 3-bit per cell and upcoming 4-bit per cell deployment.,“Marvell is expanding and broadening our leading portfolio of NVMe SSD controllers to help our customers address the growing amount of diversifying SSD product opportunities with emerging 3D TLC and QLC NAND components,” said Nigel Alvares, vice president of SSD and Data Center Storage Solutions at Marvell. “Our common SSD hardware and firmware controller architecture spanning our client, data center and enterprise products enables our customers to quickly develop tailored SSDs for each of these segments with minimal incremental engineering effort and achieve optimal return on investment of their precious firmware engineering resources.”,In the chart we see the next generation NVMe controllers compared to the 88SS1092 ""Eldora."" Eldora shipped in products like the ,and ,. Marvell more than doubled the random read performance over the previous generation 8-channel controller and produced a 1.5x increase on the new 4-channel controller.,The duo will generate a wide variety of products that fit a wide range of price points and form factors. The 88SS1084 will power devices as small as M.2 2242 with four channels on a single-sided printed circuit board. The 88SS1100 will power high-performance products likely to ship in the M.2 2280 and add-in card form factors.,“We are excited to grow our strong collaboration with Marvell to enable our next-generation BiCS FLASH Gen.4 devices with its latest family of SSD controllers,” said Hiroo Ohta, technology executive at Toshiba Memory Corporation. “Marvell’s common SSD hardware and firmware controller architecture will help our mutual customers accelerate time to market of their SSD solutions and position them for market share gains across all segments.”,Marvell SSD controllers are known for their longevity. The new controllers offer compatibility with existing 3D flash memory and upcoming 96-layer 3-bit per cell that we will learn more about at Computex and Flash Memory Summit in August. The new controllers also support upcoming 4-bit per cell ""QLC"" but will likely not power the first wave of retail devices that could ship before the end of 2018."
ASRock's Optane 905P M.2 RAID Defies Limits,"ASRock inadvertently tipped off  Reddit when hidden images of ,. The company, like Optane technology, reduced the latency required to bring important data to shoppers. ASRock is a strong supporter of all things Optane and has one of the best quad M.2 VROC HBAs on the market today that cools the drives and gives users the option to deliver extra power via a 6-pin VGA plug.,Combining ASRock's Fatal1ty X299 Professional Gaming i9 XE's VROC array feature and Intel's new Optane SSD905P M.2 is a guaranteed recipe for excitement here at Computex 2018.,The display is the first to show what four 380GB 905P SSDs in RAID 0 can achieve when paired with a great motherboard and an 18-core Extreme Edition to process all the data. The system chews through 10,000MB of sequential data in a single second, a 4x improvement over a single 900P 480GB Optane SSD. The drives scale well in RAID 0 with this workload, but users have to give up low queue depth random performance. ASRock's solution is to use a 480GB Optane 900P for the system's boot drive and then utilize the VROC array feature for heavy sequential workloads like intense video editing.,Intel hasn't disclosed when the 905P M.2 SSDs will hit e-tailers, but we expect to see the components before the end of 2018. Using a single drive, or an array built with several drives, is the best way to accelerate any complicated workload, but there are advantages of building the Optane storage for specific tasks in the workflow. We hope to see Intel make improvements to VROC in the future so one path delivers the best of both worlds. The feature allows us to break past the PCH limits by going around the chipset to send data directly to the CPU. Maybe Intel's , can get us around the low random performance of VROC."
"SMI Only Has One Thing To Say At Computex: Move Over, Samsung","Silicon Motion, Inc controllers shipped in 30% of the world's SSDs last year. The company had a successful entry into the consumer SSD market and within just five years is ready to challenge Samsung for the performance crown.,The top-tier performance comes from the SM2262EN, the successor to the SM2262 found in well-priced products like the Adata SX8200, HP EX920, and Intel 760p. The new controller features a software upgrade that significantly increases performance and pushes the user experience to new heights with commodity flash.,The SM2262EN supports existing and next generation flash memory with speeds of up to 800MT/s per channel. The 8-channel controller is also a drop-in replacement for existing SSDs designed around the SM2262 controller. A powerful 4th generation LDPC engine provides the robustness to support next generation QLC memory as well as the 96-layer TLC coming to market in 2019.,We've learned from manufacturers that the SM2262EN already has design wins. Adata plans to update the SX8200 with a new model in the same 8000 series family using the controller.,It's easy to see why companies plan to launch products with the new controller. SMI's internal testing shows the drive outperforming the Samsung 970 Pro in several key 4-corner tests and, unlike the 970 Pro, partners plan to launch 2TB models to gain market share in the void.,The SM2262EN display is far from a parlor trick. The company, just like years past, allowed us to run tests on the system to see firsthand how fast the new SM2262EN paired with 64-layer memory is. We will report back with a full preview article detailing the inner workings after returning to the test lab. So far, the initial performance shows a strong user experience that is simply the next step up from the already brilliant retail drives shipping today with the SM2262 controller.,If Silicon Motion's partners are able to meet or exceed the current mainstream NVMe price points where the SX8200 and EX920 reside, this will be a very popular controller for our readers."
Lexar Gains A2 Certification For New 512GB microSD Card,"Since the start of Computex 2018, a number of companies have announced 512GB microSD cards, but the first product came from Integral Memory based in London back in January. Since then Adata, PNY, and now Lexar have unleashed products with the same capacity. But the new Lexar is different from the rest: it's the only product to gain A2 certification, making it the fastest available for running applications on your smartphone or tablet.,""Turning it up to two"" just doesn't have a strong enough ring to it, but it's the equivalent to 11 when it comes to SD application performance, because the rating indicates that a product is capable of at least 4,000 read and 2,000 write IOPS. Here's what having an A2 certification entails:,""The Application Performance Class 2 (A2) is defined by SD Physical 6.0 specification. It makes SD memory card much higher performance than A1 performance by using functions of Command Queuing and Cache. Efficient flash memory management can be supported by Maintenance functions. Application Performance Class can be applied to UHS SDHC/SDXC Memory Card product family."",We ,, and since then the company has focused on building its brand and establishing a network of retail sellers. Its parent company, Longsys, is the largest buyer of Samsung flash memory and the largest SSD manufacturer in China. You probably don't recognize the Longsys name but you do know its products; it manufactures SSDs and SD-type products for the world's largest brands.,It's easy to see how the acquisition of Lexar, one of the most trusted brand names in the U.S., will play out over time with the backing of such a strong and diverse company behind the wheel. The company has a number of interesting products in the works that are just begging to be revealed.,Aside from the A2 certified microSD card, Lexar also announced a new high-speed USB portable SSD called the SL100 Pro. This drive reaches up to 850 MB/s sequential performance and will ship in capacities of 240GB, 480GB, and 960GB. The USB 3.1 Gen 2 drive features a small, yet sturdy enclosure that fits well in your shirt or jeans pocket with room to spare."
Cryorig Unveils Frostbit M.2 SSD Cooler With Dual Heatpipes,"SSD throttling got you down? If so, Cryorig has you covered with its new Frostbit M.2 SSD cooler that it will introduce at Computex. The company claims the passive cooler is the industry's first dual heatpipe cooler for M.2 SSDs.,Even garden-variety SSDs have thermal throttling mechanisms that reduce performance during use to keep your SSD healthy–particularly the SSD controller. Unfortunately, these throttling mechanisms can engage and disengage rapidly, so it can be hard to detect. Throttling definitely has an impact on SSD performance, specifically during extended tasks, like large file transfers.,Many new M.2 SSDs come with either affixed or optional heatsinks to dissipate waste heat, but those models are usually more expensive. Some tricked-out motherboards also come with built-in M.2 SSD coolers, which also helps. If you have a cheaper motherboard or an M.2 SSD that comes without an integrated heatspreader, the Cryorig Frostbit might be a good solution.,The Frostbit design features an ""Ultra Thin"" heatpipe embedded in the base of the cooler, which helps distribute heat from the M.2 SSD components evenly. The larger 6mm heatpipe pulls the heat into the passive radiator, which sports 38 fins, from both ends of the smaller heatsink.,It doesn't help if you have a fire-breathing GPU right on top of your M.2 SSD, and that's usually the case. Unfortunately, many M.2 SSD slots are positioned between PCIe slots on the motherboard, which means they tend to be buried under the GPU. That also makes it difficult to attach a bulky passive cooler, or one of the more ,.,Cryorig addresses the problem by allowing you to adjust the cooler and offset it from the GPU, as seen in the graphic.,The heatsink is rather small, measuring 72 x 27.3 x 57mm. You'll notice the 72mm length doesn't entirely cover a standard M.2 2280 form factor SSD, which is 80mm long. Instead, the cooler is designed to cover just the components on the SSDs' PCB and not interfere with the mounting screw or interface, which are on the opposing ends. Of course, this means the cooler wouldn't be effective with longer SSDs.,The passive cooler, which weighs 56g, can dissipate up to 12W, which is far beyond what you will find with a typical M.2 SSD.,Cryorig hasn't shared pricing or a release date yet, but we should learn more at the looming Computex."
Adata Reveals New Industrial 3D NAND SSDs,"Adata announced a new set of industrial-grade M.2 SSDs featuring both PCIe x4 and SATA controllers.,The new Adata IM2 series of SSDs are designed for multiple platforms, with 3D TLC NAND flash memory, end-to-end data protection, and variable capacities. The IM2P33F8 features a PCIe 3.0 controller with support for NVMe 1.3 and comes in three capacities (128GB, 256GB, and 512GB). The IM2P33F8 SSDs are all rated for up to 2,050 MB/s and 1,600 MB/s for sequential read and write speeds, respectively.,The IM2S3168 SSDs seem more tuned for datacenter environments, with support for 256-Bit AES encryption, SM4, and TCG Opal 2.0. The SATA 6 GB/s controller is considerably slower than that of the IM2P33F8, with up to 540 MB/s and 510 MB/s in sequential read and write performance, respectively. The capacities of the SATA-based SSD are also more varied, with 32GB, 64GB, 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB drives.,Pricing for Adata’s new industrial grade IM2-series SSDs are currently unavailable, but considering that these drives are available only from the company’s website for industrial clients, we likely won’t see these products hit the consumer market anytime soon."
Microsoft Patches Up Intel And Toshiba SSD Issues With Windows 10,"Microsoft's RS4 update to Windows 10 has been rife with bugs, the first of which began with crashes, boot loops, general instability, and performance problems with Intel SSDs. ,which found Microsoft blocking updates to users of ""certain"" Intel SSDs, before either company would name the specific drives impacted. After a round of emails, we learned that the bugs specifically impacted Intel's SSD 600p Series and SSD Pro 6000p models. The following week, Microsoft also began to block updates to systems that used Toshiba SSDs, citing reduced battery life with a few unnamed models. ,Microsoft's new KB4100403 addresses the issues and updates Windows 10 to OS Build 17134.81. The ""known issues"" portion of the , includes a listing that the company fixed the issues with both Toshiba and Intel SSDs. The update also lists Toshiba's XG4, XG5, and BG3 series as the impacted SSDs.,We imagine that the fixes will be implemented in a forthcoming update, thus allowing users of the impacted SSDs to update to the new version of Windows 10. You can install this new patch manually, but Microsoft will also push it out through its (maddening) automatic update feature during the June Tuesday Update. ,Neither Intel, Toshiba, nor Microsoft has fully explained the technical glitches that led to the issues with Intel and Toshiba's SSDs, but they are widely attributed to the various low-power states that SSDs fall into during light use.,The update also includes miscellaneous fixes:,Addresses an issue in Internet Explorer that might cause communication between web workers to fail in certain asynchronous scenarios with multiple visits to a web page. Addresses additional issues with updated time zone information. Addresses an issue where closed-caption settings are preserved after upgrade. Addresses a reliability issue that may cause Microsoft Edge or other applications to stop responding when you create a new audio endpoint while audio or video playback is starting. Addresses an issue that may cause Windows Hello enrollment to fail on certain hardware that has dGPUs. Addresses an issue with power regression on systems with NVMe devices from certain vendors.,Meanwhile, Microsoft is now grappling with update bugs that impact Dell Alienware products. These issues also appear to revolve around low power states. Upon resumption from sleep, Dell's Alienware products are generating a black screen. As a result, Microsoft has now suspended updates to those machines, as well."
Corsair's MP300 Entry-Level Consumer NVMe SSD Starts At Just $57,"Hot off the presses for Computex 2018 is the new Corsair Force MP300 NVMe 1.3 M.2 SSD. Corsair announced the drive during our flight over, so we learned about it at the company's booth, where the drive was prominently on display. We also spotted the series on Newegg as well with prices ranging from just $57 (120GB) to $362 (960GB).,The drive is up to 3x faster than SATA and was designed to help users transition away from the antiquated serial bus that was built for slower media. Yet Corsair's approach to the entry-level SSD market comes at a bad time, with pricing pressure coming from all directions. High-quality SATA SSDs like the Samsung 860 EVO 1TB just hit $250 (and even $150 for a few hours) and mainstream NVMe drives like the Adata SX8200 960GB sell for just $350.,Corsair will have a difficult time getting this ship off the ground with current pricing for all but the 120GB model, which sells for dinner money at less than $60. At that price it's hard not to consider the MP300 for a secondary drive used to ease the load on your primary storage by keeping cold data like movies, music, and even games on the MP300.,Corsair backs the new MP300 with a 5-year warranty, the same as ,. The new series also comes with support for Corsair's SSD Toolbox software and features a copper sticker that spreads the controller heat to aid in keeping the drive cool under intensive workloads."
Micron Announces QLC NAND SSDs Up To 7.68TB,"Micron announced that it is shipping new SSDs with Quad-Level Cell (QLC) NAND. SSDs have already largely killed off ,, but QLC flash will increase NAND storage density by 33%, which will boost SSD capacity and reduce costs even further. That means standard 3.5"" HDDs are also now in the crosshairs.,Micron is currently shipping the 5210 ION SSDs to several of its strategic partners and customers. The 5210 SSDs leverage the SATA interface and come in capacities ranging from 1.92TB to 7.68TB in a slim 7mm 2.5"" form factor. Micron's new SSDs are slated for a full release in fall 2018, but the leading-edge products are destined for the data center. As we often see with enterprise SSDs, we expect the new technology to filter down to desktop PCs eventually. In fact, Micron's partner Intel also announced that it is developing QLC SSDs for both consumer PCs and the data center.,SSDs based on Single-Level Cell flash debuted in 1987. SLC flash stores a single bit per NAND cell and uses two voltage states. SLC eventually gained traction in the mainstream, but it took nearly ten years of mass SSD availability before the industry moved to storing multiple bits per NAND cell. MLC flash stores two bits per cell and requires four voltage states per cell.,Storing more bits per cell increases density and reduces cost, so Triple-Level Cell (TLC) was a natural progression. TLC NAND stores three bits per cell and uses eight voltage states per cell. Now TLC flash comes in nearly every SSD, even those destined for heavy-use enterprise environments, and the advent of 3D NAND has enabled even more capabilities.,Micron 64-layer 3D QLC NAND will store four bits per cell with 16 voltage states--a feat that would be impossible with planar (2D) NAND. The extra voltage states increase stress on the NAND, which results in less endurance. It also takes longer to program 16 voltage states per cell, which results in decreased performance.,But the payoff comes in the form of Micron's 1 terabit (128GB) die density, which provides 33% more storage capacity than the company's MLC NAND die. Micron currently produces MLC NAND packages with 16 die, and a similar approach with QLC NAND could yield up to 2TB of storage in a single chip. Theoretically, QLC could enable up to a 33% reduction in cost, but Micron isn't sharing pricing information yet.,Surprisingly, Micron's QLC can withstand 1,000 (program/erase) cycles. Micron isn't sharing endurance specifications yet, but the company says the QLC SSDs will have nearly 1 DWPD (Drive Write Per Day) of endurance. The company achieved this feat with standard error correction techniques, which hints that it might be possible to extract even more endurance with stronger error correction technology. Micron also claims that the QLC SSDs adhere to JEDEC's stringent endurance requirements, which state that enterprise SSDs have to retain stored data for three months without power (after endurance has been exhausted). Micron also says that it isn't using compression technology with the new drives, which suggests the company isn't using its ,.,Micron's ION SSD lineup also features all of the enterprise-class features of its ,. That includes power-loss protection, data path protection, a five-year warranty, AES 256-bit and TCG Enterprise encryption, and a device-level internal RAID implementation that helps protect user data (RAIN).,The industry has slowly transitioned to less-endurant SSDs as data centers have learned more about their endurance requirements. Today, most high-endurance enterprise SSDs feature 3-5 DWPD of endurance, but that pales in comparison to the 25 DWPD SSDs that were common just a few short years ago. QLC NAND will be used only to store infrequently-accessed WORM (Write Once Read Many) data, so endurance and performance aren't as much of a concern. These read-heavy workloads consist of AI workloads, big data applications like Hadoop HDFS, content delivery systems, and scale-out archival storage, among others. Micron shared performance results in several enterprise workloads, which we've included in the album below.,QLC SSDs will also draw considerably less power than HDDs, while still delivering more performance and capacity in a smaller space. HDDs drop into lower power states when they are idle, but each step down in the idle states results in increased response time when the drive is asked to satisfy requests. In contrast, SSDs can drop into low-power states and resume quickly when called upon. Micron claims its QLC SSDs draw 10% less power during a heavy workload than a comparable HDD array, but more importantly, they draw 3X less power during read-centric workloads.,QLC SSDs also bring all of the same density advantages over HDDs that we find with existing MLC SSDs, which already stretch up to 7.68 TB in a 7mm 2.5"" form factor. In contrast, most of those SSDs use the SAS interface, while Micron's 5100 series uses the ubiquitous SATA interface. Micron says that it will develop QLC SSDs with other interfaces, too. The company doesn't develop SAS products, so we will likely see QLC SSDs paired with the NVMe interface in the near future.,Micron will share more concrete performance and endurance specifications when the drives come to the general market in the fall. Micron's first-gen QLC SSDs don't use performance-boosting features, like the emulated SLC layer we see in TLC SSDs, so it's possible the company can provide faster models for the consumer market in the future. Intel and Micron are still jointly developing NAND through their IMFT partnership, but that partnership is slated to end after the third-generation of their flash technology. Micron uses IMFT's second-gen NAND to build QLC products, and Intel plans to release data center and client (consumer) storage products based on the same QLC NAND, but it hasn't provided a release date or specifics."
Synopsys Shows World's First USB 3.2 Demo With 20Gbps Speeds,"Last September USB-IF, the USB governing body, published the specifications for USB 3.2. The emerging specification bonds two 10Gb/s channels together to achieve up to 20Gb/s of throughput. That's half the throughput of Thunderbolt 3, which is USB's strongest competitor.,Synopsys released a video of the world's first USB 3.2 demonstration. Synopsys used a Windows 10 host system running existing USB drivers embedded in the operating system. The target device was a Linux system configured as a mass storage device running a powerful array capable of at least 2,000 MB/s of throughput. The prototype hardware sitting in the middle consists of USB PHYs built on the FinFET process running at 10 Gb/s per lane. According to Eric Huang from Synopsys, lane bonding allows the interface to achieve USB 3.2 speeds.,We don't expect to see any device-side products using the new standard until mid- to late-2019. When these products do emerge, they will utilize commodity Type-C cables. Synopsys was very specific about the cables used in the demo. The company tells us that it used off-the-shelf Belkin USB 3.1 Type-C cables (like pictured above), which are the same as you can purchase at Target or other big box retails stores today.,USB 3.2's increased bandwidth will enhance existing technologies, but you'll need to purchase new hardware. We should see USB-connected monitors and storage products adopt the technology first, followed by professional and consumer devices soon after."
PNY Announces Massive 512GB MicroSD Card,"PNY just announced the new 512GB Elite microSDXC memory card, which is large enough to take the capacity crown away from , SanDisk released in February. For $350, mobile data hoarders can store over 80 hours of Full HD video or 100,000 18MP pictures.,The 512GB Elite satisfies the performance requirements to meet Class 10 and U1 ratings but not the hefty A1 requirement for application performance in a mobile device. PNY claims up to 90 MB/s performance over the UHS-1 interface but doesn't specify random performance, which is used to achieve the A1 rating.,Compatibility is always a concern for large capacity microSDXC products. PNY includes an SD adapter with the 512GB Elite for use in a PC or Mac but didn't publish a list of supported mobile devices.,PNY is the first to announce a 512GB microSD card, but we know more will come in a few weeks at the Computex trade show in Taipei, Taiwan. The increase in density is a direct result of advances in flash technology. PNY didn't disclose the technology used to make the 512GB Elite microSDXC possible but it's likely the result of new 4-bit per cell memory (QLC) from Toshiba.,What worries us about the 512GB Elite microSDXC is the lack of any published endurance specifications. QLC is new, unproven memory technology for consumer devices and will require powerful software error correction technology that increases power consumption over the life of the device."
Toshiba Ships Powerful XS700 External SSD,"With Computex right around the corner and big announcements coming from persistent memory manufacturers, Toshiba has cut the line to begin shipping the new XS700 portable SSD ahead of the information flood. We spotted the new portable SSD drive on Toshiba's website two weeks ago when the company quietly eased it into the market. Since then, the XS700 went unnoticed until Toshiba Memory America's announcement.,The drive utilizes Toshiba's impressive 64-layer BiCS FLASH technology and marries it with a USB 3.1 Gen 2 interface that enables up to 550 MB/s sequential read and 500 MB/s sequential write performance. The website only lists a single capacity--240GB--at time of writing. We found , priced at $95 and covered with a 3-year warranty. Toshiba said the drive will also be available on Amazon.,""Engineered with the reliability and stability that are hallmarks of Toshiba SSDs, the XS700 is extremely rugged and has no moving parts – making it a highly durable and efficient way to safeguard data. The drive is covered in aluminum, is shock-proof and has been drop-test certified at a height of two meters. Other security-focused features include a utility that enables users to password-protect their drives and conduct maintenance, monitoring and additional tuning."" - Toshiba Memory America,Like many new portable SSDs, the XS700 uses a compact design, measuring in at 2.95 x 3.74"" and weighing 90g. Toshiba chose exFAT for the file system to maximize compatibility across devices, and to further round out the feature list, the company includes a software layer that allows users to password protect their data. Toshiba said the XS700 series is ""starting"" with the 240GB capacity drive, so more are likely to follow."
Windows 10's April Update Crashes Systems With Intel SSDs (Updated),"Microsoft , that it's blocking some systems with Intel SSDs from receiving the Windows 10 April 2018 update. Microsoft's , to Windows 10 systems on April 30, but the update has caused some systems with Intel SSDs to enter a UEFI screen reboot or crash repeatedly. For now, users with unspecified Intel SSDs will not receive the April update automatically, and they also cannot install the update manually.,Microsoft has pushed updates to many systems with Intel SSDs already, but it advises impacted users to roll back to Windows 10 version 1709, which you can do by hitting F8 during the boot process and restoring the previous version of the operating system. ,But who are the impacted users? Microsoft hasn't shared the specific Intel SSD models that are impacted by the errors. We also aren't sure if the error applies to ,. Microsoft also cites performance and stability issues as key components of the errors, so it's possible that users with the April update can unknowingly suffer from reduced performance if they have an Intel SSD installed in their system. As such, until Microsoft or Intel provides a list of specific models, it might be wise to roll back your operating system to 1709 if you have an Intel SSD.,The company also hasn't shared any technical details about the errors. The errors are surprising given that Intel's SSDs use industry-standard protocols, such as SATA and NVMe, that ensure broad compatibility. We also don't know if these issues pertain only to SSDs that use a certain protocol. Intel does deliver its own custom drivers for some products, so there is a chance that the fix may require a combination of a new Intel driver along with changes from Microsoft.,Windows 10 will receive a ""future"" update to address the issue, at which point users with Intel SSDs can migrate to the April 2018 update. However, Microsoft has not released a firm arrival date for the fix. We've reached out to Intel and Microsoft for a list of the impacted SSDs. We will follow up as we uncover more information."
G-Technology Releases Flash-Based Storage For Creatives,"The NAB trade show is in full swing, and out of it comes high-speed storage device news for ""creatives."" G-Technology (a Western Digital Company) has three new flash-based storage systems that set new performance records for the company's products. These devices are designed to allow users to work with very high resolution video in real time.,All three devices offer various levels of portability, Thunderbolt 3 connectivity, and a blistering fast 2,800 MB/s sequential performance rating.,We start with a quick look at the new portable G-DRIVE Mobile Pro SSD with Thunderbolt 3 connectivity. G-Technology offers this series in 500GB and 1TB capacities. Prices starts at $650 (50GB) and leap to $1,050 (1TB). The aluminum chassis has an NVMe SSD tucked inside that delivers up to 2,800 MB/s of sequential throughput. The enclosure likely uses an SSD that is similar to the WD Black and SanDisk Extreme Pro that come with WD's new NVMe controller. The high-speed portable storage device ships with a half-meter cable and instruction guide.,Additional features for the G-DRIVE Mobile Pro SSD include a five-year warranty, three-meter drop protection and a 1,000lb crush-proof rating.,The G-Technology G-DRIVE Pro SSD trades portability for increased capacity. It comes equipped with Thunderbolt 3 pass-through to support daisychaining devices. This system shares the same 2,800 MB/s sequential performance rating as the G-DRIVE Mobile Pro SSD. Capacities move to 960GB for $1,400 and 1.92TB for $2,100. Unlike the portable model, the G-DRIVE Pro SSD is not bus powered, so you are tied to AC power from a wall outlet.,The system ships with the power adapter/cable and a Thunderbolt cable.,The new G-SPEED Shuttle Thunderbolt 2 SSD moves away from the NVMe protocol but increases the capacity, and price, to serious levels. This system ships in two sizes, 8TB for $5,100 and 16TB for the bargain price of $7,600.,G-Technology didn't give us many details about the internal drives but we suspect the disks share similar specifications to the WD Blue 3D that ,. The chassis holds up to eight drives but still features a small desktop footprint. Resting inside is a hardware RAID controller with support for RAID 0, 5, 10, and 50. The two Thunderbolt 3 ports give users daisy chain support along with a 2,800 MB/s performance rating."
Tech Tom’s Relies On: Asustor AS3204T NAS,"Everyone in tech knows , who takes it upon themselves to remind everyone, every chance they get, of the importance of backing up data. Annoying as this behavior can be, perhaps it’s for the better, because there’s also the other , who never listens to this sound advice. I wasn’t quite the latter, but I definitely didn’t back up as much as I should and could have.,That changed early last year when, for the first time ever, I irrecoverably lost some of my data. Without any signs of impending failure, my Z77 motherboard went up in sparks and killed the SDD and all three of the 1TB hard drives inside my desktop. The SSD was a goner, but advice from the , gave me hope of recovering data from the hard drives. Unfortunately, life was only briefly restored to one of them, and it wasn’t for long enough to evacuate any data.,Fortunately, I had backed up the important parts of those drives, so their loss wasn’t crippling. The event did, however, put the fear of god into me, and I resolved not to continue without a solid backup plan. I decided that the cheap and convenient cloud-backup service CrashPlan was the perfect solution. It took nearly a week to upload and synchronize with the server, but I felt I was well protected after. That cozy feeling didn't’ last long long, however, and my CrashPlan Home subscription metaphorically crashed when the service surprisingly , operation in late 2017.,I trusted CrashPlan because I knew the service had been operating for years and was generally well-received. CrashPlan did offer alternatives: upgrade to a small business account for exactly double the price or switch to a competitor. I decided to do neither and instead go back to doing local backups, but this time, I’d automate it with a NAS. As secure as cloud services claim to be, there’s no point to them if they stop servicing you.,I was well aware of RAID, which most NAS makers expect people to use, but I was only looking to use my NAS as a device to store individual drives. After a few weeks of research, I settled on the ,. It’s not the cheapest four-bay NAS--the , can be had for less--but it is pretty cheap for one with a quad-core x86 processor, dual rear USB 3.0 ports, and a direct video output. I wasn’t buying it to do video transcoding, because all my media devices have PCs attached to them, so the desire for an x86 processor was admittedly irrational. I planned to use the dual rear USB ports for external expansion and backup, and I convinced myself that the direct video output, which is only HDMI 1.4, might be useful in troubleshooting in case I can’t reach the NAS over the network.,Although I won’t put the blame on Asustor, the AS3204T proved that my buying criterion were a bit out of line with what a NAS is meant to be. Setting up the device was simple, even for a NAS newbie like me. The AS3204T doesn’t have hot-swap drive bays, so you have to disconnect and open the unit to install drives. This process reveals a well-cooled processor, a well-placed 120mm fan that blows evenly over the drives, and generally high-quality construction. After connecting the NAS to my router, I used its web interface to complete the setup. You can also use an app to set up the NAS, but I didn’t need it, or the HDMI port, because I was instantly able to access the NAS using its IP over the network.,A flawless boot process was a welcome surprise for me, because I knew NASes can be finicky, but some of the limitations of an embedded Linux system immediately started to become apparent. For starters, I wasn’t expecting the NAS’ OS and apps to actually require some space on one of the drive volumes. The NAS itself has 512MB of flash to hold the OS, but that’s not considered a volume. Only drives in the drive bay can be volumes, so you’ll need at least one to even boot the NAS. It effectively uses one of the volumes as a “C:” drive. This doesn’t consume an appreciable amount of space, but it does mean that you can only freely swap out, at most, three of the four drives in the NAS.,Another thing I quickly discovered is that the Asustor can’t use external drives as storage expansion. Like all NASes, the AS3204T can access external drives formatted in file systems different from its own, but it can’t put them onto the network or add them as a volume. You’re limited to accessing them through the NAS’ file browser or backup app.,For an experienced NAS user, these limitations might be commonly understood, and they don’t detract from the fact that my AS3204T has operated and performed flawlessly. Its SMB service works by default, so mapping the NAS’ volumes as network drives in Windows is simple. Its speed over the network caps out at ~106MB/s, which is close enough to saturating gigabit LAN to satisfy me.,The AS3204T has also seen major and minor software updates applied without hassle. I don’t have any other NAS to compare to, but so far, I’ve found Asustor first-party software to be reliable. The UPnP server, which I briefly fired up to test, doesn’t transcode media unnecessarily and correctly sends native files according to what my devices support. The automated backup software has all the flexibility I need. And the NAS’ settings has detailed controls for power saving and drive spin-down.,I haven’t dug into the AS3204T’s other features as I basically use it purely as a device to host network drives and run backup routines. In truth, I probably paid much more than I needed to for this basic functionality, but at least it performs outstandingly in its most important functions."
Intel's New Optane 905P Is The Fastest SSD Ever,"The king is dead. Long live the king. According to our early test results, Intel's just-announced Optane SSD 905P SSD (960GB) is the fastest storage device by a wide margin. The $1,299, 960GB HHHL add-in card dominated other top-performers such as the , and Intel's own , drive.,For example, when we ran PCMark 8, the Optane 905P was 11 percent faster than its next closest competitor, the Optane 900P (480GB) and more than 300 percent quicker than the Samsung 970 EVO(1TB).,Cost-conscious shoppers can spend $599 to get the 480GB, U.2 version of the 905P, which we have not yet tested. These drives are additions to Intel's 900P series of Optane-powered SSDs so they don't replace siblings like the 900P (480GB).At press time, Newegg had both 905P drives, but the 960GB model was sold out.,The 960GB 905P also has two blue LED strips on the sides that illuminate the inside of your case. Both 905P drives promise up to 2,600 MB/s sequential read and 2,200 MB/s sequential write speeds. Intel claims a random performance of 575,000 IOPS read and 550,000 IOPS write.,We've only had our 960GB add-in card for a few hours, but we were still able to run some tests. The 905P isn't just the fastest consumer SSD ever released--because it sports higher performance than the P4800X enterprise version with the same 3D XPoint memory technology, this is the fastest SSD ever released for any market.,Intel bills the 905P as a workstation product designed to accelerate extended workloads. It features incredible low queue depth performance but really shines when the CPU wants to chew data at high rates. With hard disk drives and even flash, the CPU will have to wait for data from the storage system. The Optane 905P feeds the processor faster, if you have a project that can actually take advantage of the performance on tap.,Compared to the Optane SSD 900P 480GB, the new 905P delivers similar queue depth 1 and QD2 random read performance. At QD4 the 905P slams into a new gear that's capable of 200,000 IOPS with a single worker (CPU core). We see a similar increase at QD4 in our random write test when comparing the previous to the new generation Optane SSD.,The 905P also boosts mixed workloads where the controller and memory must execute complex IO steams with data coming and going at very high speeds. The increased mixed workload performance leads us to believe the 905P will increase application performance over the previous generation. We'll know more in the coming days as we execute some of our own mixed IO with testing and writing the review happening simultaneously.,Look for our full review of the Optane 905P later this week."
Samsung's 970 Series SSDs Are Now Shipping With Across The Board Price Cuts,"Samsung's 970 Series NVMe SSDs began shipping this week after a brief digestion period between the reviews coming online. The new EVO and Pro lines shipping would normally generate news on its own, but Samsung added some spice to the launch with aggressive price cuts. The new prices bring the two series closer to mainstream pricing where we find other products like the fabulous Adata SX8200 and HP EX920.,We spotted the new 970 line on Newegg after receiving a note from Samsung's outside PR agency. The company didn't give us a reason for the price cuts, but it's not difficult to see why after reading the reviews.,We mentioned Samsung's pricing in , and found the original MSRPs out of balance with the rest of the market.,Toshiba and Micron are pumping out competitive 64-layer NAND to third-party SSD companies, so Samsung has lost some of its advantage. The Toshiba and Micron flash, when paired with the right controllers and firmware, deliver EVO-class performance. As a result, the EVO series isn't the clear-cut performance leader, and some competing products cost quite a bit less. Samsung certainly didn't face this challenge with its dominant 950 and 960 NVMe SSDs.,The largest cuts impact the two 970 Pro NVMe SSDs with 2-bit per cell (MLC) flash. This caught us by surprise, because Samsung has the only new MLC NVMe in 2018. This may be the writing on the wall for the faster NAND technology that is expensive to manufacture. If the company can't make high margins on MLC flash now reserved exclusively for professional users running heavy workloads, we may see it disappear completely.,Samsung shaved $130 off the price of the 970 Pro 1TB for a new MSRP of $500. The 970 Pro 512GB is now a bargain at just $250, down from $330. This is a product for users willing to spend more today for a high-performance SSD that will outlast every other component in their PC.,The 970 EVO product line saw less aggressive cuts that range between $10 and $50. The $50 cuts go to the 1TB and 2TB models, where Samsung has more room to maneuver. The 970 EVO 500GB drops from $230 to $200, putting in closer to emerging mainstream products with the new Silicon Motion, Inc. SM2262 controller paired with Micron 64-layer TLC. "
Micron Breaks Ground On New NAND Fab In Singapore,"Micron broke ground on a new fab Wednesday that will output 3D NAND memory for devices in 2020. The construction is on the Singapore Micron campus where the company has a significant footprint already. This is the third phase of expansion for Fab 10, with the first two already producing most of the company's 3D NAND wafers. ,Phase 3 construction should be completed by Q2 2019, with the first wafers rolling off the lines by Q4 2019. Volume production will not start until 2020. The company will be far beyond the 64-layer memory in production today but did not say what process will come from the new facility.,IMFT (Intel Micron Flash Technology) produced 17.1% of global flash production in 2017, according to DRAMexchange. The numbers put IMFT in third place behind Toshiba/Western Digital (34.4%) and Samsung (36.9%). Following the next generation past 64L, Intel and Micron will part ways, leaving both companies trailing SK Hynix (11.6%). Samsung has already announced intentions of doubling output of 3D NAND wafers from China by 2020. Current production is estimated to be 110,000 300mm wafers. , with new manufacturing in Japan.,Micron hired around 7,500 people in Singapore with a projected growth of another 1,000 with the new fab and additional R&D investments."
"Gigabyte Enters The SSD Market With UD PRO, Aorus Branding","With an abundance of flash available, we should see more non-memory companies jump into the SSD pool. With one swift proclamation tweet, Gigabyte did just that. The company will launch several products in different form factors over time, but it's starting with the SATA 6Gbps 2.5-inch UD Pro Series using Toshiba BiCS3 FLASH. ,“SATA interface SSDs are mainstream and have a considerable development history. The challenge is to develop a product of exceptional quality that stands out from the rest,” said Jackson Hsu, Deputy Director of the GIGABYTE Channel Solutions Product Development Division. “GIGABYTE UD PRO series SDDs are a testament to our strict adherence to producing high quality products. With DDR3L RAM, 3D NAND Flash memory, 256GB or 512GB storage capacity selections, the UD PRO series SDDs offer users a high performance, high stability, and high capacity product choice, without sacrificing flash memory or performance.”,Gigabyte is a diverse company with several divisions and product lines that span the far corners of the PC and server markets. Adding flash-based storage is a way to further diversify while giving loyal fans another avenue to feed the machine. Solid-state drives open the door for more bundling options with other products like motherboards, graphics cards, and notebooks.,The new UD Pro product series initially comes in two capacities, 256GB and 512GB. Prices look very aggressive at $68.99 and $119.99, but don't expect breakthrough performance from this series. The UD Pro is more of a mainstream SSD with 530 MB/s sequential read and 500 MB/s sequential write performance. The 512GB UD Pro sports the highest random performance of the two with up to 80,000 IOPS read and 75,000 IOPS write. The drives look like a good low-cost alternative to the Samsung 860 EVO and other top performance SSDs shipping today.,Gigabyte reached out to us this morning to say the company will soon launch M.2 NVMe and add-in card high-performance variants soon under the AORUS brand. We should see these and more exciting products at Computex next month."
TeamGroup Launches An RGB-Lit SATA SSD,"By announcing an RGB-lit SSD, TeamGroup is already in rarified territory. But merely slapping some RGB accents onto an SSD wasn’t enough for the company--it had to go and create what it calls the most lit of all RGB-lit SSDs. (""Lit"" in the literal sense, not the colloquialism. We hope.),We’re not kidding. TeamGroup cites the 5:3 “ratio of non-luminous area to luminous area” as one of the , defining aspects. The 2.5” SSD comes in two styles: a static RGB version called the “simple” and a digital-RGB version called the “magnificent.” Lighting control on both versions is done through a separate connection. The difference is that the static version connects to standard 4-pin or 5-pin RGB headers, and the digital-RGB version connects to 3-pin digital-RGB headers. The T-Force Delta’s surface has two lighting sections but really only one zone.,If you’re thinking that TeamGroup is selling the T-Force Delta’s aesthetics harder than its performance, well, you're probably right. We don’t know much about what’s inside the fancy RGB covers. The SSD uses an unspecified type of 3D NAND flash and an unspecified SATA SSD controller. The drive comes in three capacities: 250GB, 500GB, and 1TB. Performance specs listed for the T-Force Delta are also scarce, with TeamGroup only listing up to 560/510 (read/write MB/s) speeds and 90K/85K (read/write) max IOPs for the 1TB version. The only endurance spec provided is a MTBF of 1M hours, but TeamGroup didn’t give the daily write amount used to calculate this. The drive is otherwise warrantied for three years.,TeamGroup did not announce pricing and availability of the T-Force Delta RGB."
"Intel Optane SSD 905P Appears Online: M.2, LEDs And A New Controller","The Optane SSD 900P launch left us scratching our heads as one question lingered. What happened to the LED version that appeared in a leaked slide several months prior to ,?,Over the weekend, several new Optane SSD SKUs and their images appeared online at Newegg, Tiger Direct and many other online stores. The LED add-in card version was among the new products that also see a name change to Optane SSD 905P.,Also this week, ASRock started uploading images with the Optane 905P product name but instead of the usual add-in card and U.2 form factors we've already seen, ASRock thinks there is a new M.2 form factor drive coming soon. If that wasn't enough Optane news, we keep seeing a part number on sale for an Optane Memory drive available to OEMs with 64GB.,Let's start with the fabled Optane SSD 9 Series add-in card, which has plasma blue LEDs under two tubular difusers on either side of the heatsink. This first appeared online in a leaked slide but was missing from the initial 900P launch. The drive first , at a trade show in Tokyo. We didn't have a lot of information nor anyone to confirm the new Optane SSD 905P name so we sat on the story. This week, we received some confirmation in the form of pictures, limited information, and some common sense.,The 905P name came back up in a big way with several reliable stores listing two versions, an add-in card and a U.2 SKU in a capacity we haven't seen before in that form factor. So far we've spotted the 905P in 280GB, 480GB, and a new 960GB capacity that was not released in the initial 900P launch. We know Intel has product numbers for two new sizes,, thanks to two documents from Intel.,The very limited information available shows some differences between the 900P and 905P. We used the data available for the add-in card to compare and contrast these two SKUs. The 900P uses 5 watts at idle but the new 905P bumps that up to 7 watts. The operating temperature also changes from 0 -75C to 0-85C. The maximum shock resistance moves from 50G to 1000G, a massive improvement.,We also spotted a new Optane SSD 905P U.2 SSD. This one doesn't have the discotheque LEDs but is sure to be the life of your storage party.,Intel never shipped the 900P U.2 in a 480GB capacity. We were told to expect a product like this in the future but as of today it hasn't shipped. We will talk more about this later in this article.,Like the announcer says on late night TV, ""but wait, there's more!"",ASRock seems to know a little more about the new 905P than the online retailers do. We found two images on the ASRock website that show the Optane SSD 905P in a new M.2 22110 form factor (,, ,). Last month , at the OCP Summit in San Jose.,The drive features a new 7-channel controller that is physically smaller than the one used in the original 900P and P4800X. We've speculated in the past that Intel used an Altera controller for the Optane products. Prior to Intel purchasing Altera, the company announced a new SSD controller. We spoke with the technology company about the controller briefly over the phone but soon after Intel acquired the company.,The controller on the Optane 900P and P4800X is physically too large to fit on a M.2 form factor card, because the footprint is actually wider than 22mm. The upcoming P4801X M.2 22110 (22mm wide, 110mm long) features a new controller with some space to spare.,We were told that the controller features the same 7 channels to the 3D XPoint memory. There are seven packages on the card, each with four 3D XPoint die for a total of 448GB of memory of which 375GB is available to the user as storage space.,The display at OCP Summit was not a product announcement so Intel would not disclose performance or power specifications.,It wouldn't make sense for Intel to do a top to bottom refresh of the 900P series that came to market last December, just five months ago. An optimized controller would be enough for Intel to run a partial refresh. With it, we may see reduced power consumption, higher performance, and as we already know, smaller form factors.,We keep running across an , on different websites. Optane Memory, the cache drive used to accelerate hard disk drive performance, , and was the first consumer Optane-branded product. ,Optane Memory uses a slightly different part number than the ,. The 64GB part is all over the web from Newegg and Tiger Direct to EBay. We've yet to find a retail product SKU for the 64GB drive but it does exist for those with a desire to experiment with the advanced cache technology. In our testing, all Optane branded products will work as a cache drive using the special Intel software and driver combination on supported 200 and 300-Series chipset motherboards. The new ,  allows users to accelerate secondary storage volumes with this cache."
"WD Announces Fast NVMe Storage For IoT Devices, Maybe An In-House Controller","At Mobile World Congress today in Barcelona, Western Digital announced two new client SSDs designed to ""enable the capture and transformation of the massive quantities of data in real-time at the edge of a smart city, smart home and personal data environment."",Essentially, the new PC SN720 and SN520 are high-speed storage devices for glorified smart lamp posts and other Internet of Things (IoT) systems covered in sensors that record your conversations, watch traffic patterns, and process data locally rather than offload it to a central server. Intel presented information on , from Taiwan's Chunghwa Telecom (CHT) at last year's Computex, but there are many other companies involved in the IoT market.,fear-inducing monitoring devices aside, the two new SSD models from Western Digital use language we haven't seen from the company before. WD said in a press release:,The groundbreaking new NVMe SSD firmware and controller architecture is purpose-built to maximize the performance and scalability benefits of Western Digital 3D NAND, and is in lock-step with the company’s NAND evolution. “With this new vertically integrated SSD platform, we are able to optimize the architecture to our NAND for low latency and power efficiency, and most important, for the growing range of applications benefiting from NVMe,” said Eyal Bek, Senior Director of Client SSD, Devices Business Unit, Western Digital. “The scalable architecture supports a range of capacity and performance points, while streamlining system qualification to improve time-to-market for our customers.”,That sounds a lot like WD just said it has a new in-house NVMe SSD controller. Did you miss it?,""...controller architecture is purpose-built to maximize the performance and scalability benefits of Western Digital 3D NAND"" [...] “With this new vertically integrated SSD platform..."",To our knowledge there is not a third party building a specific controller exclusively for WD's BiCS FLASH memory. The closest we've seen so far is the Phison E12, but that also supports Toshiba's BiCS FLASH. The second section we highlighted tells us more. ""Vertically Integrated"" is code for ""we make the components."" Samsung uses the phrase all the time because it designs and manufactures the SSD controller, DRAM, and NAND flash.,WD says the PC SN720 is capable of up to 3,400 MB/s sequential read and 2,800 MB/s sequential write speeds, which means this model is a very fast SSD capable of competing with the best Samsung has to offer today. The series will ship in sizes from 256GB to 2TB.,WD didn't disclose performance information for the PC SN520, but did say it will ship in several form factors from M.2 2280 to M.2 2230 in capacities of 128GB to 512GB. The release went on to say this model has one of the lowest power draws in the industry.,The release didn't mention pricing or time frame for availability, but we're more interested in seeing this cross over to the consumer upgrade market, possibly in the reshaping of the Black PCIe series."
SanDisk Has A 400GB MicroSD Card For $300,"SanDisk announced the new Extreme UHS-I microSD Card at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. The drive fits 400GB on a card the size of your fingernail and takes the ,world's fastest"" honor with up to 160 MB/s sequential read performance.,SanDisk says the new model is 50% faster than the previous generation. Sequential write performance tops 90MB/s, according to the company's internal testing. The SanDisk Extreme UHS-I microSD Card meets or exceeds the A2 specification for random performance used to launch apps at high speeds on mobile devices. The cost is less micro--expect to shell out $300 for the largest capacity and fastest SD card available.,Here's what SanDisk said about its new card in a press release:,“Consumers expect an increasingly better mobile experience, and with our 3D NAND technology, we are pushing the boundaries of innovation to enable them to create and enjoy more rich content on their devices. Our expertise in flash memory and microSD card electronics enables us to achieve unmatched performance. The breakthrough SanDisk microSD card is evidence of Western Digital’s commitment to delivering more advanced solutions that enable data to thrive,” said Jim Welsh, senior vice president and general manager, Client Solutions, Western Digital.,Parent company Western Digital is also showing a new mobile storage technology based on PCI Express ""in anticipation of the next generation of high-performance mobile computing requirements."",The technology uses the latest PCIe 3.0 standard with a single lane capable of up to 985 MB/s. This technology has been discussed several times in the past but lacks the device support needed to spur production of the storage component. We may see moves in PCIe-based mobile storage this year, however, as companies look to new technology to increase performance and reduce power consumption."
Need A 100TB SSD? Nimbus Data Has You Covered With The ExaDrive DC100,"Nimbus Data introduced its new 100TB ExaDrive DC100 SSD today. The company claims this is the largest SSD ever produced. This SSD, ,, sports a SATA connection. Even though it is designed primarily for the data center, the SATA connection means it is compatible with just about every desktop PC.,So what does 100TB of SSD storage give you? Nimbus Data claims it can store up to 20 million songs or 20,000 HD movies, but unlike the normal SATA SSDs in your PC, this model comes in the 3.5"" form factor, meaning it is the size of a standard hard drive.,The SSD also comes with unlimited write endurance over a five-year warranty period, which we haven't seen since the days of SLC NAND. For reference, most competing enterprise SSDs now have a 2-5 DWPD (Drive Writes Per Day) endurance rating. Many enterprise SSDs also have a dirty secret: they throttle performance as you approach per-day endurance limitations. In contrast, the ExaDrive DC100's unlimited write endurance allows it to operate at full performance throughout its lifespan.,The ExaDrive DC100 provides up to 100,000 random read and write IOPS. The DC100's random read IOPS are slightly higher than most enterprise SATA SSDs, but its random write performance is in a league of its own compared to other SATA SSDs. The drive also sports up to 500 MB/s of sequential read and write throughput, which is comparable to the fastest enterprise SATA SSDs. The DC100's write speed is fast for a SATA SSDs, but it isn't enough to wear down the huge helping of flash over the five-year warranty period.,Nimbus Data gears the drive for hyperscalers, such as Google, Facebook, Baidu, and others, so power efficiency is another key metric. The company claims the DC100 is the world's most energy efficient SSD, which is a hard claim to fact check. In either case, it only draws 0.09W to 0.14W-per-TB, which is lower than many competing SSDs. That works out to 9W of idle power consumption and a 14W typical rating. Nimbus Data claims this is 85% lower than competing SSDs.,The drive uses 3D MLC flash from SK Hynix and another as-yet-unnamed supplier. That advance allowed the company to double the density of its existing SAS models that it OEMs to other companies, such as ,. The drive comes with four internal controllers arranged in an ECC alignment along with a central control processor that orchestrates data traffic. Much like ,, we expect the drive has multiple PCBs housing rows of NAND and controllers inside the device. The company also has a 100TB SAS model planned.,The drive does have DRAM onboard, but the company isn't ready to disclose the precise amount of memory on the drive. In either case, the drive also has other features we expect with enterprise-class SSDs, such as capacitor-based power-fail protection and a 2.5 million hour MTBF rating.,Nimbus Data certainly isn't a household name, but it has over 200 customers for its enterprise all-flash arrays that include such names as eBay, PayPal, and Disney, among others. Now the company is moving into the broader SSD market and is already sampling early adopters. The company says the drives will be generally available in summer 2018, but it hasn't disclosed the pricing yet. It did say that dollar-per-GB pricing should be comparable to existing MLC SSDs for OEMs, which means these drives will carry a hefty premium compared to client drives. We expect more details as the drives come to market."
Adata Announces XPG SX950U SSD,"Today Adata announced the latest addition to the XPG product line designed for gamers and performance enthusiasts. The new XPG SX950U SSD comes to market in four capacities ranging from 120GB to 960GB. The company released only the bare minimum specifications to get some something on paper. For instance, the controller inside the SX950U comes from Silicon Motion, Inc. (SMI) but Adata didn't say what specific part number. We suspect this is the SMI SM2258 controller paired with Micron's 2nd generation 3D 3-bit per cell technology.,Adata released some performance data for the new SX950U line. The sequential read performance reaches as high as 560 MB/s, the upper limit of the SATA 6Gb/s bus with overhead factored in. The 120GB drive achieves up to 300 MB/s sequential write performance but the three larger capacities are capable of delivering up to 520 MB/s.,Adata will back the new series with a 5-year warranty, but the company didn't detail any endurance limitations for the data written.,The SX950U hardware configuration mimics that of the successful Crucial MX500. The MX500's success came from R&D with the proprietary cache algorithm called Dynamic Write Acceleration. Adata, working with SMI, pieced together an advanced cache algorithm that uses the DRAM to cache user data as well as the flash translation layer map. The SX950U also uses a SLC buffer system for data writes called Intelligent SLC Caching to increase performance.,Picking winners and losers is more difficult than explaining the technology. Adata has a long history of bringing products to market at competitive prices. The XPG SX950U press release didn't list any pricing details, but we suspect this will be another competitive product that steers the pricing curve at a greater downward angle. SSD prices, especially SATA-based products, have already started down a downward trajectory now that the manufacturing of flash has caught up to demand. Over the coming year supply will grow beyond demand and prices will rapidly decline.  ,TrendFocus, an analyst firm, recently predicted SSD price reduction will spur an increase in SSD adaption by OEMs. The company projects new notebook systems will reach 50% SSD adoption this year, a 5% increase from 2017."
Samsung Power Outage Kills 3.5% Of Global Flash For March,"According to multiple reports from news outlets in Taipei and South Korea, Samsung's Pyeongtaek fab experienced a power outage on March 9, 2018. The outage lasted for only thirty minutes, but the impact can be calculated in dollars per second.,Up to 60,000 wafers were damaged, according to the report, which is 11% of Samsung's overall NAND flash output for March. That equates to 3.5% of global NAND wafer production.,Increased global production from Samsung and its rivals should offset the loss globally. These companies enjoy a small stockpile of flash memory that didn't exist last year due to strong demand and lower production output as companies shifted to new 64/72-layer memory.,We've yet to see market reaction to the March 9 event, but with word spreading rapidly, we may see some price increases overnight. Any price changes should subside quickly with the Pyeongtaek fab running at planned capacity again.,At the end of the month, Samsung will begin the expansion of the Xi'an factory that was built in 2014. The factory currently produces around 120,000 wafers per month, but the expansion will add another 200,000 to the monthly capacity after completion. However, Samsung's competition also plans aggressive expansion in the years to come."
"Seagate Demos World's Fastest Hard Drive, Doubled Performance, HAMR Progress","Seagate displayed the world's fastest hard drive today at the Open Compute summit and announced that it has surpassed industry reliability standards with its new HAMR HDDs.,The new drives use Seagate's Multi-Actuator technology, ,, to deliver twice the performance of a standard hard drive. Seagate has branded the new actuator technology as ""Mach.2"" and set a new record for a single hard drive with 480 MB/s of sequential throughput, which is more than twice the standard 235 MB/s of the speediest 7,200-RPM enterprise HDDs. It's also 60% faster than the leading 15K HDDs. The new drives are currently geared for the data center, but we expect the technology will eventually filter down to the consumer market.,The new drives have two sets of actuator arms that each contain their own array of heads. The host system can access each set of heads independently, thus providing twice the throughput.,With twice the performance in hand, Seagate also announced that its Exos drives will also soon have HAMR (Heat Assisted Magnetic Recording) technology that can enable up to 20TB of capacity in a single drive by using tiny lasers on data recording heads. The lasers heat the surface of the drive platter to over 400,C for a split second, which allows it to store up to 2Tb of data per square inch. We have much more in-depth coverage of the technology in our recent , article, including pictures of the new laser-infused recording heads, so head there for more detail.,Drive endurance and reliability are the biggest concerns with HAMR technology, but Seagate claims to have surpassed the industry standard reliability metrics for standard hard drives. Seagate announced at the OCP summit that HAMR-infused recording heads are capable of transferring data for 6,000 hours, or more than 3.2 petabytes of data. That is more than 20x the reliability of an industry standard recording head.,Seagate plans to merge both the HAMR and Mach.2 technologies into its Exos hard drives to boost both performance and capacity. Seagate hasn't defined a release date or pricing yet, but with units already in the hands of leading customers, we imagine these drives will come to market sometime later this year."
"Powenetics: A Better Way To Measure Power Draw for CPUs, GPUs & Storage","Tom’s Hardware is a global organization, with offices and labs in the U.S., France, and Italy that coordinate ahead of big graphics card launches. Performance testing typically comes from our lab in the U.S., while a German colleague works on power, acoustics, and thermals. A team of translators works tirelessly in the hours before those NDAs lift to stitch both pieces together for our respective audiences. With mere days between receiving cards and publishing reviews, it’s always a sprint to get a comprehensive story posted in time.,The power-consumption measurement hardware that our German colleague relies upon is quite the setup. It includes two multi-channel scopes, current clamps, slimline probes, and a 5 ¾-digit multimeter. In all, that's more than $10,000 worth of equipment. The work that went into setting all of this up allows us to characterize each card's consumption needs at idle, under extremely high loads, and everywhere in between. In fact, we were the first to break the news of Polaris’ tendency to draw too much current from the PCI Express slot in our ,, thanks to this hardware.,Unfortunately, it’s not easy to replicate that setup across all of our labs, for technical and economic reasons. So, we've been on the lookout for alternatives accessible to other editors. Our key wish-list criteria were lower-cost gear and ease of use, while not compromising accuracy.,Aware of our situation, Aris Mpitziopoulos, Tom's Hardware's power-supply reviewer, developed , in conjunction with Cybenetics. (See Aris' disclaimer at the end of this article.) Aris offered Tom's Hardware a pioneering role in the roll-out of Powenetics, providing the blueprints needed to configure our own power-consumption-measuring test bench and a premium version of the software, along with support to add features and fix bugs.,In the following pages, Aris will walk us through the composition of a Powenetics-capable test bench, explore its use, and present some preliminary results. But first, let's take a peek at the first Powenetics platform built in the Tom's Hardware U.S. lab...,The system employs a modified power supply, to which we attach a number of voltage/current sensors from a German company called Tinkerforge. Seasonic graciously provided its 1300W Prime Gold PSU for us to cut into, and Lian-Li sent over an open test bench for the whole configuration to live in.,A riser card is fitted out with two more Tinkerforge Voltage/Current Bricklet sensors for reading the PCI Express x16 slot's +12V and +3.3V rails.,The build process was spread over a couple of evenings. Nothing about the construction was particularly complicated, so long as you can get over the idea of cutting into modular power-supply cables to insert the Tinkerforge Bricklets in-line. Otherwise, soldering wires to the PCIe riser card was probably the toughest step (though it could have been easier with a second set of hands).,There's still work to do cleaning up all of the wiring to prevent short circuits, to be sure. But the hardware and software are very much functional in the lab, collecting data in a number of gaming, torture-test, and mining workloads.,Curious to learn more about how this collection of components and a custom-written utility can replace thousands of dollars' worth of lab gear? Read on!,Again, the , project was conceptualized by Cybenetics, a company you may have seen us mention for its work determining power-supply efficiency and noise levels. For this project, the purpose was to enable power-consumption measurements for graphics cards, storage devices, and CPUs. It's a combined hardware and software solution designed to be highly affordable, easy to use, and accurate (with fast polling rates to catch spikes that put a lot of stress on PSUs).,To keep the implementation cost low and to make the hardware as accessible as possible, the necessary components were chosen carefully. Not a single custom-made part is needed. The sensors used by the system come from ,, while the PCI Express x16 extender is manufactured by Adex Electronics. Tinkerforge is located in Germany and ships its products worldwide. Adex is located in the U.S., but it has distributors in Europe, as well.,The power measurements this system generates are not based on Hall-effect sensors, but rather on current shunt resistors. This provides increased resistance to EMI noise. It also makes the installation easier, since you only have to install the graphics card as you normally would. That means there's no need to mess with current clamps.,Moreover, the system can be upgraded easily to support multiple graphics cards, to take readings from the EPS cable, or to accommodate additional hard drives. As it stands now, though, the basic version of Powenetics supports only one graphics card with up to three PCIe connectors, along with the power consumption of all three rails (+12V, 5V, and 3.3V) through a SATA cable. While it's entirely possible to install more than one SSD or hard drive on the same cable, yielding overall power consumption, the more practical application is one drive per cable, so as to isolate the individual devices.,An enhanced version of the Powenetics software makes it possible to collect CPU power measurements through the monitoring of up to two EPS cables.,Another reason to favor current shunt-based power measurements is that you get voltage information at the same time as current readings, yielding power. This isn't the case with Hall-effect sensors, with which you have to synchronize voltage and amperage data. With fast data-polling rates (in the 2ms range, for instance), this might be exceedingly difficult, given the latency of USB or Ethernet interfaces connecting measurement equipment to logging devices.,Each of the sensors used by Powenetics can measure 20A of current, 720W of power, and 36V. The minimum resolutions are 1mA, 1mW, and 1mV over the operating range, and bidirectional current measurements are also possible."
New Intel RST Driver Increases Optane Memory Capabilities,"Intel's , comes with a welcome addition designed to dramatically increase your system's responsiveness. The new Rapid Storage Technology (RST) 16.0.2 driver removes the exclusive primary boot volume limit for Optane cache technology with Optane Memory.,Now users will be able to accelerate a secondary storage volume with Intel's Optane Memory, Optane SSD 800P, and Optane SSD 900P products. That should broaden the appeal to the enthusiast crowd because Optane caching delivers a small benefit for caching SSDs, but explosive performance gains for HDDs. Many enthusiasts use a small SSD for their operating system and a larger hard drive to house large Steam libraries. That makes Optane caching especially appealing for the secondary HDD volume because it will boost game load times and responsiveness with frequently-accessed files. ,The driver is not exclusive to the new 300-Series chipset products announced today. It's also backwards compatible with older chipsets but only adds the new Optane-specific features to 200-Series chipsets. Users of 100-Series chipsets are still locked out from using Optane Memory technology, officially, but you can still run the physical drives as cache SSDs with older Smart Response Technology (SRT) cache as long as the system will remap the PCIe lanes through the chipset.,Intel tells us the new RST 16.0.2 WHQL driver will show up online shortly. You should be able to find it on the , on Intel's website.,The new Intel Core+ branded processors bring Optane Memory cache technology to mobile users, as well. A handful of companies announced notebook products at Computex last June with Optane Memory as a feature to cache the system drive. Many of those products failed to materialize as retail products. Intel's new ""Plus"" branding is a ""simplified"" way to say a new system ships with Intel's 8th generation Core processor and Optane technology.,A small plus sign is as insightful as the word ""Optane"" to most shoppers. Hopefully we don't have to relive the , product name thing again while trying to talk about ,3D XPoint memory.,If you're not up to speed on the benefits of the high-speed memory technology used as non-volatile storage, we have three product reviews that fill the ,, ,, , verticals.,The technology works as advertised and notably increases system performance by opening windows and applications faster than a hard disk drive. The effect is less noticeable for users coming from flash-based storage, though."
Zotac Botches Mek1 Storage Specifications; Corrections Forthcoming,"We recently received a Zotac Mek1 gaming desktop for review, and in the midst of our rigorous testing, we discovered a discrepancy in the product’s advertised specifications.,The Mek1 is the first ,, and it’s been available for purchase for some time now. It comes in a static configuration, with a Core i7-7700 processor, 16GB of DDR4-2400 memory, a GeForce GTX 1070 Ti graphics card, and a 240GB PCIe NVMe SSD for primary storage. However, the storage specifications posted on the company’ website and online retailers, in addition to its packaging, were less than accurate.,Although the company didn’t disclose the manufacturer of the storage drives used in the Mek1 on its ,, Zotac originally advertised the primary SSD as an “NVMe PCIe x4 SSD,” as the screenshot above details. However, in the course of testing for our review, we found that storage test results were uncharacteristic of a PCIe 3.0 x4 NVMe SSD. Upon further investigation, we confirmed that our review sample of the Mek1 has a Phison PS5008-E8 M.2 PCIe 3.0 x2 NVMe SSD inside it, instead of an x4.,We reached out to Zotac to see if this was the case for all production models of the Mek1, and Zotac was quick to confirm that all Mek1 PCs ship with Phison PS5008-E8 or E8T PCIe 3.0 x2 SSDs. It clarified that until now, the mislabeled storage specification had gone unnoticed, and that the company would immediately begin changing its marketing materials to reflect the actual components.,“It was a misunderstanding by PM,"" a company representative said. ""The slot is PCIe x4 ready but the drive itself is only PCIe x2. We are correcting the spec now on the website and everywhere else very soon.”,To further complicate the matter (and to possibly quell the fury of anyone who may feel cheated out of a PCIe x4 SSD), the Mek1’s packaging is also mislabeled, with the top panel of the box (pictured below) indicating that one M.2 SATA SSD is pre-installed in the PCIe x4 slot. This is also inaccurate and misrepresentative of the actual class of performance you get from the PCIe 3.0 x2 Phison SSD inside the Mek1--except in this case, you should get , performance compared to a SATA drive.,The mashup of inaccurate specifications in various marketing materials and packaging paints the picture of a rushed OEM that may not have been sure what storage would ship inside its first-ever full-sized desktop PC. Given the multiple discrepancies, it seems that the mislabeled specs leans more towards a massive mistake than malevolence, though. However, the fact remains that this simple mistake misrepresented the storage performance to potential buyers who may have expected higher performance than what they got.,To Zotac’s credit, the company responded to our inquiries quickly. The Mek1 product specification page has already been updated (within about 15 minutes of our last email) to omit the “x4” label from the SSD in its storage specifications. Retail sites such as , still have the incorrect storage specification listed (as of this writing), but Zotac insisted all pertinent outlets have been notified. The packaging error is a different matter, but it should also be rectified in time."
"Adata's New Flagship, The GAMMIX S11 SM2262 NVMe SSD","Adata announced the XPG GAMMIX S11. This is the successor to the , and the new flagship NVMe SSD from Adata. The new drive shares performance specifications with , (and was the winner of a ,).,The Silicon Motion, Inc SM2262 controller is poised to make a big splash this summer. The controller has already made an impact on the market when it was released in the ,. More companies plan to release products using the same high-speed, low-cost design. The design is so good that Adata has released a second SSD with the SM2262 before we've even had a chance to look at the XPG SX8200.,Adata tells us the GAMMIX S11 version with a heat sink runs up to 10C cooler than the naked SX8200. Users can benefit from the cooling when installing or transferring large amounts of data to the drive. The cooler eliminates or prolongs thermal throttling that slows the drive to keep the controller from overheating.,The SM2262 controller pairs with IMFT 64-layer 3D memory, delivering 3-bits per cell. The combination delivers up to 3,200 MB/s sequential read and 1,700 MB/s sequential write performance with Adata's custom firmware. Random performance tops 310,000 IOPS read and 280,000 IOPS write. Adata only listed performance for the large 960GB drive. The series also includes 480GB and 240GB models, but we expect lower performance in the smaller sizes.,There's no word on pricing and availability at this time from Adata ,but the GAMMIX S11 series ships with a lengthy five-year warranty."
